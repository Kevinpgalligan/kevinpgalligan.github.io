<h2 id="title">Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio</h2>
<p>These are data science and machine learning projects I've worked on in my spare time. Further description, and links to Jupyter Notebooks, can be found below.</p>

<p>Implementing the Naive Bayes classifier to achieve almost 99% test set accuracy on Kaggle's <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset/">SMS Spam Collection Dataset</a>. The classifier also achieves high precision (98.8%) and recall (92.7%). The features are based on words used, as well as the presence of money symbols and numbers of various lengths.</p><hr><h4 id="linear-models-and-gaussian-discriminative-analysis-of-iris-dataset">Linear models and gaussian discriminative analysis of iris dataset</h3>

<p>An implementation of value iteration to find the optimal policy for reinforcement learning problems. In the scenario depicted above, the agent is placed 3 cells across and 3 cells down in a 3-by-4 grid. The top-right corner is the goal state, giving a reward of +1. Below that is a fail state, giving a reward of -1. Every other state gives -0.1, incentivising the agent to not dilly-dally. The arrows indicate the direction to move, as proposed by the optimal policy. There's a 75% chance of moving in the intended direction, and a 25% chance of veering left or right. This is why, at grid position (2,3), the optimal decision is to go left, avoiding the possibility of accidentally reaching the fail state.</p>
