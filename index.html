<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Kevin Galligan. This is where I keep my software and writing.</p>

<p>I just submitted my PhD thesis, which is about decoding algorithms for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">error correction codes</a>. Before the PhD, I worked as a software developer at Amazon Web Services for ~3 years.</p>

<p>Contact me at <a href="mailto:galligankevinp@gmail.com">galligankevinp@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Infrequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><b>Q: Does your stuff have a license?</b></p>

<p>All of the content on this site is under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">CC BY-NC license</a>. Basically, do what you want, but give me credit and don't try to sell it.</p>

<p><b>Q: What do you like to write about?</b></p>

<p>It's kinda difficult to summarise, so here are the tags I've used on my blog.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/tag/probability.html">probability</a> (6) <a href="/blog/tag/programming.html">programming</a> (6) <a href="/blog/tag/data.html">data</a> (5) <a href="/blog/tag/rant.html">rant</a> (3) <a href="/blog/tag/simulation.html">simulation</a> (3) <a href="/blog/tag/problem-solving.html">problem-solving</a> (3) <a href="/blog/tag/web.html">web</a> (3) <a href="/blog/tag/ai.html">ai</a> (2) <a href="/blog/tag/ireland.html">ireland</a> (2) <a href="/blog/tag/meta.html">meta</a> (2) <a href="/blog/tag/artsy.html">artsy</a> (2) <a href="/blog/tag/books.html">books</a> (2) <a href="/blog/tag/pop-culture.html">pop-culture</a> (2) <a href="/blog/tag/phd.html">phd</a> (1) <a href="/blog/tag/vim.html">vim</a> (1) <a href="/blog/tag/lisp.html">lisp</a> (1) <a href="/blog/tag/python.html">python</a> (1) <a href="/blog/tag/tutorial.html">tutorial</a> (1) <a href="/blog/tag/game-of-life.html">game-of-life</a> (1) </p>

<p><b>Q: Why doesn't your blog have comments?</b></p>

<p>It's easier to maintain a static site. All I have to do is upload the files to GitHub Pages and they're magically available to the world. I might eventually set up a server to host comments.</p>

<p><b>Q: What's the story with the icon?</b></p>

<p>I needed an icon and drew something vaguely inspired by the Game of Life. This is what happens when you plug it into the Game of Life.</p>

<img class="centered" alt="The site's icon, animated" src="/static/img/life.gif">

<p><b>Q: What have people said about you?</b></p>
<p><i>You're a calming presence</i> - a colleague.</p>
<p><i>The author is lacking in many respects</i> - an insightful HackerNews commenter.</p>
<p><i>At least I won't be remembered as a coward</i> - a brave internet user.</p>

Why are you reading this?
<p><b>Q: What are your interests?</b></p>
<p>I've always been interested in too many things. As a result, I'm not particularly good at any of them. I'm not even a Jack of All Trades, more like a Jim. Anyway, the current list is: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20359763-kevin-galligan">reading</a>, writing, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/kevingal/">watching movies</a>, playing music (mostly on the guitar), learning languages (Spanish and Irish), history podcasts, <a href="https://lichess.org/@/kpgiskpg">Chess</a> (Scotch, Caro-Kann, Smith-Morra, looking for a d4 defence) and programming. I go through periods of taking up physical activities, currently trying to improve at swimming. I would love to learn how to draw, but all of my attempts have failed.</p>

<p><b>Q: Which software do you use?</b></p>

<p>Linux Mint, Python, C/C++, Common Lisp, vim, Emacs, tmux, Firefox, Thunderbird (email, calendar, RSS).</p>
