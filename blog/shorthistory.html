<h2>A short review of A Short History of Nearly Everything</h2>
<p>If you stacked 1000 copies of blah blah.</p>
<p>So goes Bill Bryson's <em>A Short History of Nearly Everything</em>, a popular science book published in the the early 00s.</p>
<p>Outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>What topics it touches on.</li>
<li>How he tells the story. Analogies. Humour. Anecdotes about scientists.</li>
<li>Wrong / out of date information.</li>
<li>Themes.</li>
<li>(In conclusion) Huge range of subject matter. I think it even touches on globalisation and how viruses can travel more easily (hello corona).</li>
</ul>
<p>Topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where we are in the universe.</li>
<li>How the universe was formed.</li>
<li>How humans figured stuff out about the planet.</li>
<li>How the Earth works (atmosphere, plates, rocks...uhhhhh).</li>
<li>How life started (we don't know?).</li>
<li>How life evolved.</li>
<li>Diversity of life.</li>
<li>...need to review the chapter list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Analogies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enlarge a cell to the size of a sphere that's half a mile in radius/diameter, it's packed full of basketballs and cars racing around. An extremely chaotic but productive factory.</li>
<li>Stretch your arms out. File a bit off the nail off your middle finger. It's as if you had erased human history from the Universe. There's also the calendar analogy, seen in Carl Sagan's Cosmos.</li>
<li>A4 sheet on the pavement beside the Empire State Building.</li>
<li>Make the nucleus of an atom the size of a pea, then the whole thing is the size of a football stadium.</li>
<li>...I'm sure there are more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wacko scientists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cavendish (wouldn't talk to people).</li>
<li>Newton (sticking metal spikes in his eye sockets).</li>
<li>JB Haldane putting people in decompression chambers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientific community gets it wrong.</li>
<li>Humans are terrible (for the environment; we're also a big extinction event).</li>
<li>The universe is an incredibly dangerous but slow-moving place. We could be wiped out by volcanos, meteors, ...</li>
<li>Most things happen at scales we can't comprehend, from the insane variety of life, to the size of the universe, to tininess of cells.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wrong / out of date info:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet.</li>
<li>We now know that there's no such thing as "junk" DNA.</li>
<li>Higgs Boson has been discovered.</li>
<li>Some napkin estimates are out of whack (distance of Betelgeuse? Need to look up other people's comments on this).</li>
<li>Bottom of church windows being thicker due to glass flowing over time.</li>
<li>Einstein being an "average" student</li>
<li>The Big Squeeze in old diving suits. Actually, that one's true (Mythbusers).</li>
</ul>
