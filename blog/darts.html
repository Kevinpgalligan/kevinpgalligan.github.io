<h2>The darts player who estimated π</h2>
<hr>
<p>A darts player and a mathematician walk into a bar. The mathematician takes a seat and orders cranberry juice, while the darts player starts practising over at the dartboard.</p>
<p>After a while, the mathematician looks over. "You're not very good, are you?" she says, as another dart whizzes uselessly into the backboard.</p>
<p>"No," says the darts player miserably. "It's almost like playing bingo."</p>
<p>At this, the mathematician's ears perk up. She sits up in her seat. "Bingo, you say?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, just watch."</p>
<p>The darts player throws a few darts at the board, and sure enough, they seem to distribute themselves across it without any noticeable pattern. At random.</p>
<p>INSERT PICTURE HERE</p>
<p>The mathematician watches with interest. She takes a sip of her cranberry juice and says, "Listen. You might not be very good at darts, but I have a fun experiment we can try."</p>
<p>She walks over to the chalkboard used for keeping score, grabs a lump of chalk and draws a circle inscribed in a square.</p>
<p>INSERT PICTURE HERE</p>
<p>"Have you heard of <em>pi</em> before?" she asks.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I think so," replies the darts player. "It's a number, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It's the most important mathematical constant. It's the ratio of the circumference of a circle," she runs the chalk over the outline of the circle again, "to its diameter." And now she drags the chalk in a straight line from the left-most to the right-most point of the circle.</p>
<p>INSERT PICTURE HERE</p>
<p>The darts player looks unimpressed. "And?"</p>
<p>"And," she beams, "using your ability to throw darts in a seemingly random pattern, I believe we can do a reasonable job of estimating <em>pi</em>."</p>
<p>"Huh. So my good-for-nothing throwing might be good for something after all. How will it work?"</p>
<p>"You'll have to throw some darts."</p>
<p>The mathematician takes a dart and throws it at the board. It hits the bull's eye. "Beginner's luck," she says apologetically to the poor darts player. "Actually, you'll have to throw a lot of darts."</p>
<p>She moves back to the chalkboard and begins to write. "If the backboard has a width and height of 1, then its area is 1. This means that the diameter of the dartboard is also 1, and its radius is half that, or 1/2. And the area of the dartboard, which is a circle, is πr<sup>2</sup>, or π/4."</p>
<p>The darts player is focused intently, struggling to recall maths classes from the distant past.</p>
<p>INSERT PICTURE HERE.</p>
<p>"The area of the dartboard," continues the mathematician, "over the area of the backboard, gives the fraction of the backboard that is covered by the dartboard. That's just π/4. Do you follow?"</p>
<p>The darts player nods. Barely.</p>
<p>"Excellent. Now, here's the key. If you throw a lot of darts at the board, and I mean a hell of a lot of darts, then we can expect <em>approximately</em> a fraction of π/4 of the darts to hit the dartboard instead of the backboard. That's because, due to your unusual gift, each randomly-thrown dart has a probability of π/4 of hitting the dartboard. If you throw N darts, then an average of π/4 times N of them will hit the dartboard."</p>
<p>She raises her arms to the sky. "And there's our estimate! The number of darts that hit the dartboard, over the total number of darts thrown, is an approximation of π/4. Multiply by 4 and out pops π!"</p>
<p>"Okay, I think I get it," says the darts player. "Let's get to work."</p>
<p>They begin the experiment. The darts player starts throwing darts with mechanical, quivering inaccuracy. He is a throwing device with every cog miscalibrated. The human equivalent of a Rube Goldberg machine. The trajectory of each and every dart is a Michaelangelo of pure, unplanned chaos.</p>
<p>The mathematician stops him after he has thrown 10 darts. She has been keeping count of how many darts have hit the dartboard, and how many have hit the backboard.</p>
<p>She whips out her pocket calculator. "All right, let's do the math. 6/10 darts have hit the dartboard." She types it into the calculator. "Multiplying by 4... gives 2.4."</p>
<p>"Oh," says the darts player glumly. "<em>Pi</em> begins with 3, doesn't it? We got the wrong answer."</p>
<p>"Not so fast. Remember when I said that you'd have to throw <em>a lot</em> of darts?"</p>
<p>And so, that's what he does. 10 throws, 50 throws, 100 throws, 500 throws. Sweat breaks out on his forehead and his arm is already complaining. But still he continues, throwing dart after dart while the bartender eyes the barely-touched cranberry juice with disapproval.</p>
<p>1000 throws, 2000 throws. 5000 throws! It seems like he has been throwing forever. Space-time appears to have been pulled and pushed so that the hours of throwing are stretched and contorted into days. The bar is spinning around him. Or he's spinning around inside the bar. He's not quite sure. But finally, when he's on the verge of physical and emotional collapse, the mathematician, who has diligently kept score the whole time, raises her hand. "I think that's enough."</p>
<p>The darts player collapses into a chair. The mathematician sits down beside him with her calculator. "Let's see. Three, eight, five, five," she vocalises, "over five, zero, zero, zero. Times four. Equals..."</p>
<p>"...three... point...one... four... one... five... nine... yes! Yes, we did it!"</p>
<p>They dance around each other, the darts player's exhaustion replaced by excited glee, the mathematician exploding with nerdy enthusiasm. Even the bartender cracks a smile.</p>
<p>Eventually, after extensive, self-congratulatory back-patting, they settle down into a relaxed stupor. The bartender servers them both a round of cranberry juice, on the house.</p>
<p>"That was fantastic!" says the darts player contentedly. "What can we do next?"</p>
<p>"Well... have you heard of <em>e</em>?"</p>
<p>TODO:</p>
<ul>
<li>The given number is only enough to get to three decimal places of accuracy.</li>
<li>Some reference to the darts player finding a use for his wonky throw.</li>
</ul>
