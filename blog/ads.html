<p>I haven't owned a television in 10 years. It was only during the COVID-19 pandemic, after moving home to live with my parents, that I became reacquainted with television advertising. During that time, I was exposed to the background hum of television on a daily basis. It was always there. Crooning to me as I sat down for dinner. Whispering in my ear as I fell asleep. Shouting at me as I left the room in search of quiet. Jumping up and down at my knee, begging for attention. It's the ad, ad-vert, ad-ver-tisement. 15 minutes for every hour of TV.</p>
<p>At first, I resisted this new source of distraction. I use ad-blocking software for a reason, I thought. Ads aren't good for your brain, and they're for suckers. I would be happy if I never saw another ad for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>O, what a fool I was. For 10 years - 10 long years! - I rejected the comforting embrace of the marketer, cast out the copywriter, and declined to break bread with the ad executive. I, a sociable animal, turned my back on good society. It's incredible to me now that I could ever have been so cruel to myself. That I could withdraw from the warm glow of the ad, when it's the nature of humans to seek warmth.</p>
<p>But worry not, my friend, for the wandering lamb has returned to the fold. After prolonged exposure to TV marketing, I have hit upon a wonderful revelation. And the revelation is this.</p>
<p><em>I love ads!</em></p>
<p>It's a trillion-dollar industry with the best of intentions. Rank upon smiling rank of ad executive, writer, creative director, smart-talker, smart-walker and CEO - all happily working away to construct a targeted message that's just for me. They dress in suits and congregate in glass towers, like an ancient, benevolent order of robe-clad monks who sit at church in fervent prayer, sending good vibes my way.</p>
<p>These are difficult times, but it is of great comfort to me to know that such a powerful force for good is out there in the world, with only my best interest at heart.</p>
<p>O cruel, needless misunderstanding! O stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast! But it is all right now. Everything is all right, the struggle is finished. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">I have won the victory over myself</a>. I love ads.</p>
