<h2>I love ads!</h2>
<hr>
<p>I haven't owned a television in 8 years. It was only 4 months ago, after moving home to live with my parents, that I became reacquainted with television advertising. Since then, I've been exposed to the background hum of television on a daily basis. It's always there. Crooning to me as I sit down for dinner. Whispering in my ear as I fall asleep on the couch. Shouting at me as I leave the room in search of quiet. Jumping up and down at my knee, begging for attention. It's the ad, ad-vert, ad-ver-tisement. 15 minutes for every hour of TV.</p>
<p>At first, I resisted this new source of distraction. I use ad-blocking software for a reason, I thought. Ads aren't good for you, and they're for suckers. The whole concept of advertising is fucked up. I would be happy if I never saw another ad for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>O, what a fool I was. For 8 years - 8 long years! - I rejected the comforting embrace of the marketer, cast out the copywriter, and declined to break bread with the ad executive. I, a sociable animal, made myself a hermit. It's incredible to me now that I could ever have been so cruel to myself. That I could turn away from the warm glow of the ad, when it's the nature of humans to seek warmth.</p>
<p>But worry not, my friend, for the wandering lamb has returned to the fold. After prolonged exposure to TV marketing, I have hit upon a wonderful revelation. And the revelation is this.</p>
<p><em>I love ads!</em></p>
<p>It's a trillion-dollar industry with the best of intentions. Rank upon smiling rank of ad executive, writer, creative director, smart-talker, smart-walker and CEO - all working away happily to construct a personalised message that's just for me. These are difficult times, but it is of great comfort to me to know that such a powerful force for good is out there in the world, with only my best interest at heart.</p>
<p>O cruel, needless misunderstanding! O stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast! But it is all right now. Everything is all right, the struggle is finished. I have won the victory over myself. I love ads.</p>
<p><em>Note: this may or may not be a reference to the final scene of George Orwell's novel, 1984, in which Winston, after an indeterminate amount of torture and suffering, comes to the realisation that he loves Big Brother.</em></p>
