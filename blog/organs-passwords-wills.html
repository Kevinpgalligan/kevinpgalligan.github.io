<p>You're going to die. Your dog is going to die. I'm going to die. We're all going to die. I feel like this is a fact that isn't repeated often enough. The blah blah people of blah have the right idea. They drape themselves with rotting meat as a constant reminder of their impending doom.</p>
<p>Given that your death is coming with 100% certainty, it would make sense to take at least basic steps to have things in order when that day comes. Such is the purpose of this post. To help you get a little bit more organised before you're hit by a truck or struck down by malaria (get statistics for these fatalities).</p>
<h3 id="organs">Organs</h3>
<p>Ensure that your organs don't go to waste. It's the least you can do as a conscientious citizen. Ireland: organ donor card or something on your wallet. In some countries, it's the default. Another option is to donate your body to science; apparently, however, people are queueing up to be cut open. There's a waiting list. In Ireland, at least.</p>
<h3 id="passwords">Passwords</h3>
<p>If you're like me, a huge amount of your creativity and personal output and communication happens behind passwords. It would be rather a shame if you dropped off the face of the earth and your correspondences had no idea of your fate. Likewise, photos and writing and the rest of your digital record.</p>
<p>Write password somewhere safe, with basic encryption. Give instructions to family and close friends on how to unlock it. How to do this without them putting you on suicide watch is another question. You really only need to give instructions for your email, password reset can cover the rest. List of people to contact in case of death.</p>
<h3 id="will">Will</h3>
<p>Material things. What to do with your possessions. What to do with your money. Comment on the default thing that happens if you don't have a will.</p>
<h3 id="and-everything-else">And everything else</h3>
<p>Having good relationships. Achieving everything you want to achieve. Making peace with what may or may not come after death.</p>
<p>Also, look up "things that people regret on their death beds".</p>
