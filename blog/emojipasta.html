<h2>The story of u/AnEmojipastaBot</h2>
<p>u/AnEmojipastaBot was a Reddit bot inspired by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emojipasta">r/emojipasta</a>. The idea was simple: turn the comments of other users into emojipasta, on request.</p>
<p>For example...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>u/JohnDoe1: it's getting hot in here</p>
<p>u/JohnDoe2: <span style="color: blue">u/anemojipastabot</span></p>
<p>u/AnEmojipastaBot: it's getting hot 🔥😍 in 🔽👏 here 💪👏</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bot was a surprise hit, spreading across the entire website and acquiring 30k upvotes (or "karma") in a handful of days. Reddit users and other bots broke it quickly in a number of surprising and amusing ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bot didn't respond when its username was uncapitalised ("u/anemojipastabot" instead of "u/AnEmojipastaBot").</li>
<li>People got it to post in inappropriate subreddits, like r/suicidewatch.</li>
<li>It entered infinite loops with other bots. The other bot would mention AnEmojipastaBot, then AnEmojipastaBot would mention the other bot, then the other bot would mention AnEmojipastaBot, and so on.</li>
<li>It crashed if the target comment got deleted.</li>
<li>It crashed if it was summoned in a subreddit where it had been banned.</li>
<li>It didn't handle random network-related errors when calling the Reddit API.</li>
</ul>
<p>These bugs were squashed, however, and everything began to run smoothly. Here are the most-upvoted comments of the bot from those carefree days.</p>

<li>...and many more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, the bot made enemies with too many important people and its account was banned permanently. For being spammy and annoying, apparently. Nobody could have seen it coming.</p>
<p>It was fun while it lasted, however, and rather than let the code go to waste, I recently resurrected it <a href="/apps/emojipasta.html">as a web app</a>.</p>
<p>For the interested, here's a brief description of how it worked (and how it still works in the web app). I wrote a script to download a few thousand comments off r/emojipasta, keeping track of which words appeared beside which emojis. The bot broke up comments into chunks of text and emojis were inserted randomly between the chunks using the word->emoji "mappings" from r/emojipasta, with a maximum of 2 emojis after each chunk. Only the alphanumeric prefix of each chunk of text was considered, so that "I'll" would give the same emoji mappings as "I".</p>
<p>That's about it. The code was pretty simple. The original source code of the bot, in Python, can be found <a href="https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/EmojipastaBot">HERE</a>. The JavaScript version that I ported recently can be found <a href="https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/KevingalWebsite/blob/master/static/js/apps/emojipasta/emojipasta.js">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>And so ends 🔚 the story 📖 of AnEmojipastaBot 🤖</p>
