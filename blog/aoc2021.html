<p>I got bitten quite badly by <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021">Advent of Code 2021</a>, and ended up solving all the problems in Common Lisp. In case you don't know, Advent of Code is a programming competition where a new problem is released every day in the lead-up to Christmas, just like an advent calendar.</p>
<h3 id="problem-review">Problem Review</h3>
<p>Here are my linecounts! </p>
<p>INSERT PICTURE HERE</p>
<p>Commentary on the problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some copy/pasted code between days. Most notably, CL doesn't come with a split function like Python! This could easily be remedied by having a utilities library. Or using external libraries. If you're taking it seriously, you really wannamake things as convenient as possible (like the ints function).</li>
<li>I overengineered day 17 (projectile), which basically turned into a mini equation solver / projectiles / engineering library. Useful to have that range code, though.</li>
<li>Graph visualisation (can't remember which day).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-observations">Other Observations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Data formats are useful to know (HTML, graphviz, that raytracing one).</li>
<li>More generally: the toolbelt analogy.</li>
<li>Competitive programming (link to betaveros; confirmed my ideas about what you would have to do to be Super Competitive, lots of practice and autodownload and utilities library)</li>
</ul>
