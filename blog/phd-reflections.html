<p>Having spent about 13% of my life to-date obtaining a PhD, I've decided to describe my experiences for the benefit of anyone who's curious about PhDs or is wondering whether to do one. I will point people to this post if they ever ask me questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's a PhD like?</li>
<li>Should I do a PhD?</li>
<li>(Something funny).</li>
</ul>
<p>every PhD is different (supervisor, subject, etc)</p>
<p>something about how it's hard to understand some things without experiencing them yourself</p>
<h4 id="my-experience">my experience</h4>
<p>cohort, 4 years, Ireland-specific stuff, stuff specific to my field, day to day life</p>
<h4 id="nice-things">nice things</h4>
<p>sense of community, opportunity to learn new things, more doors are open, diverse skills (presenting, writing, researching), learn what research is</p>
<h4 id="not-so-nice-things">not so nice things</h4>
<p>stressful w/ pressure to publish, isolating, everyone seems to have bad times during it, maybe everything challenging &amp; worth doing is stressful most challenging bit isn't necessarily research, you don't get to spend your whole time learning, it's difficult to reproduce results &amp; share your code, impostor syndrome, politics (Condo example), supervisor-dependent, financial aspect</p>
