<p>In October of 2023, I flew to Spain and walked over 600km along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago">Camino de Santiago</a>. I kept a diary throughout this journey, writing in broken Spanish. Here, I'll give a brief introduction to the series of diary entries, which I have now transcribed and translated to less-broken English.</p>

<h2 id="whats-a-camino">What's a Camino?</h2>
<p>The Camino de Santiago ("Way of St. James") is a network of pilgrimages or walking routes. They're mostly situated in Spain, and the endpoint of all the routes is Santiago de Compostela, a city in the autonomous community of Galicia. Hundreds of thousands of people walk these routes every year. Some of them do it for spiritual reasons, but nowadays I think most people just do it for fun. The tradition is over 1000 years old.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="why-did-you-do-it">Why did you do it?</h2>
<p>I can't remember how I discovered the Camino. A lot of people, especially from North America, first hear of it through a Martin Sheen movie called <em>The Way</em>, but I haven't ever seen that. Someone probably mentioned it to me during the 3-month Spanish course I did in Valencia. Wherever I got the idea, I'd been excited by it for a long time (adventure! introspection! nature! Spanish!), and after submitting my thesis in September of 2025 it seemed like the perfect time to go.</p>
<h2 id="which-route-did-you-take">Which route did you take?</h2>
<p>The Camino del Norte, or "Northern Way", is a route along the coast of northern Spain. I picked it because it's less crowded than the the most popular route, the Camino Francés ("French Way"). I thought the people there might be more interesting, and it'd be less touristy.</p>
<!--I'm not sure if this comes from a nonconformist streak or what, but I often seem to pick options from the 2nd tier of popularity. I studied Spanish in Valencia instead of Madrid or Barcelona; in school, I joined the underpopulated German class rather than one of the many crowded French classes; and my favourite programming language is the underappreciated Common Lisp. On the other hand, I follow the recommendations of others when it comes to movies, books, music and food.-->

<p>The Norte starts in Irún, in the Basque Country of northeastern Spain. It consists of about 35 stages, depending on how you break it up. Given that I only had 30ish days to spend, I decided to skip a few stages and start in Bilbao instead. This shaved off about 150km, which happened to be the most mountainous and difficult part of the Norte, but I still had to walk over 600km.</p>
<p>Here are the stops I <em>planned</em> to make along the way, with particularly difficult segments marked by an X. The total distance was 667.8km.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bilbao</li>
<li>Portugalete (19.4km)</li>
<li>Castro Urdiales (25.4km)</li>
<li>Laredo (25.8km)</li>
<li>Guemes (29km)</li>
<li>Santander (15.2km)</li>
<li>Santillana del Mar (X 37km)</li>
<li>Comillas (22km)</li>
<li>Colombres (28.8km)</li>
<li>Llanes (23.2km)</li>
<li>Ribadesella (31.4km)</li>
<li>Sebrayo (X 31.6km)</li>
<li>Gijón (X 35.8km)</li>
<li>Avilés (25.4km)</li>
<li>Muros de Nalón (23.2km)</li>
<li>Soto de Luiña (15.3km)</li>
<li>Cadavedo (18.5km)</li>
<li>Luarca (15.3km)</li>
<li>La Caridad (30.5km)</li>
<li>Ribadeo (21.6km)</li>
<li>Lourenzá (X 28.4km)</li>
<li>Abadín (25.2km)</li>
<li>Vilalba (20.7km)</li>
<li>Baamonde (18.6km)</li>
<li>Sobrado (X 39.8km)</li>
<li>Arzúa (22km)</li>
<li>Pedrouzo (19.3km)</li>
<li>Santiago de Compostela (19.4km)</li>
</ol>
<p>In reality, this isn't the precise route I ended up following, and I actually got to Santiago ahead of schedule. A few reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li>For one segment, I took the bus instead of walking, because I had a minor injury and wanted to rest. This earned me a scoff from an annoying Camino purist or two.</li>
<li>I used the Buen Camino app for navigation (among other things). I didn't realise that the stages in the app were different to the stages I'd copied from pilgrim.es, and so I accidentally ended up following the app's much more ambitious schedule for the first few days.</li>
<li>There were a few branching paths that I hadn't anticipated. Sometimes I took a more scenic route, sometimes I took a shortcut.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had a few days to spare at the end, which I used to explore Santiago and visit Finisterre. I envisioned myself reading Sylvia Plath's poem of the same name, <em>Finisterre</em>, in the final moments of the trip. [Editor's note: well, aren't you a pretentious little sod?]</p>
<h2 id="what-did-you-pack">What did you pack?</h2>
<p>I had a relatively small backpack, with a capacity of 22L. It weighed 4-6kg, depending on whether my water bottle was full and whether I was carrying food. Many other pilgrims commented on how small and light my bag was. It was a conscious choice - all the guides said to be minimalist and reduce weight as much as possible. I may have taken it a bit too far, though.</p>
<p>Here's the full list:</p>
<ul>
<li>22L backpack.</li>
<li>3 pairs of socks (merino wool, helps to avoid blisters).</li>
<li>3 pairs of underwear.</li>
<li>3 t-shirts (synthetic material, dries faster).</li>
<li>1 pair of shorts (hiking shorts, dry quickly).</li>
<li>trail runners (breathable, good foot support, dry quickly when wet).</li>
<li>rain poncho (keeps bag and upper body dry).</li>
<li>light jumper.</li>
<li>scarf.</li>
<li>baseball cap.</li>
<li>sunglasses.</li>
<li>microfiber towel (dries fast).</li>
<li>passport.</li>
<li>water bottle.</li>
<li>pharmacy stuff (in a plastic bag): suncream, paracetamol, antihistamines, insect spray, blister plasters / bandages, vaseline.</li>
<li>toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
<li>a bar of soap (for washing self + clothes)</li>
<li>phone/charger.</li>
<li>converter for sockets.</li>
<li>e-reader.</li>
<li>journal + pen.</li>
<li>3 safety pins (for hanging wet clothes off the backpack when walking).</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are some things I might change with hindsight, I feel that the packing was a success! Possible amendments:</p>
<ul>
<li>I probably should've brought another pair of shorts, because with only 1 pair I needed a private room in order to wash and dry them.</li>
<li>The scarf came in useful on one or two particularly chilly mornings, but mostly felt like a waste of space. And I looked kinda ridiculous wearing a scarf with shorts.</li>
<li>It would've been good to have a container for my soap, because it made a mess when wet. I kept it in its original, papery container, which had almost completely disintegrated by the end of the trip.</li>
<li>The sunglasses weren't needed when I had a baseball cap. As it happened, though, I lost the baseball cap and the sunglasses got some use.</li>
<li>I only read ~100 pages on the e-reader (<em>Los detectives salvajes</em> was a slog), but I would be reluctant to give it up.</li>
<li>Earphones would've been helpful on days when I was extremely bored, but I didn't bring them because "living in the moment"... or something. I ended up daydreaming a lot and not paying attention to my surroundings, so I probably should've just brought earphones.</li>
<li>Some pilgrims marvelled at my lack of a sleeping bag, and a few albergues (hostels) didn't provide a blanket at night, but I managed to survive the cold by draping my towel &amp; jumper over myself. I'd suggest bringing a light sleeping bag.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-did-you-plan-the-trip">How did you plan the trip?</h2>
<p>My main resource was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CaminoDeSantiago/">r/CaminoDeSantiago</a>. The discussions and guides on there cover everything you might need: routes, packing, walking tips, accommodation, weather, blister prevention, etc. I also used <a href="https://www.pilgrim.es/en/northern-way/">pilgrim.es</a> for route planning, and the Buen Camino app was helpful too. I didn't book any accommodation before the trip, which ended up biting me on the first night. After that, I sometimes booked accommodation ahead of my arrival in a town, but that mostly wasn't necessary.</p>
<h2 id="you-kept-a-diary-wow-loser">You kept a diary? Wow, loser.</h2>
<p>Yep. Almost every day. And I always went back to fill in the days I missed. It was a lot of work, but I didn't have much else to do in the evenings, and I'm glad to now have a record of my trip.</p>
<p>I wrote in Spanish, for the sake of practice. This somewhat limited what I could express, but I usually managed to capture the day's events with the generous use of a dictionary. I wrote in a mixture of present and past tense, but for the transcription I'm converting everything to the past tense, because otherwise it'd be hard to read. I've also done extensive editing, moved some non-chronological bits around, and added details that I neglected to write down at the time.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-you-eat">What did you eat?</h2>
<p>At the time I did the Camino, I was vegetarian. Sometimes I had to settle for subpar or expensive veggie food, especially in small villages, but for the most part it was fine. I ate a LOT of tortilla de patatas (Spanish omelette), as they're available in all the cafeterías. It would've been much harder as a vegan. I suspect I would've had to cook for myself a lot more and carry more food supplies with me.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-you-writing-this">Why are you writing this?</h2>
<p>Seems a shame to write so much and not share it with anyone. Also, it's fun.</p>
