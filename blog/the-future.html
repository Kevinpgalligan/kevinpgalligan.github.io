<p>I launched this website and blog in September 2021, about 5 years ago. Back then, I wrote self-consciously and with the ultimate aim of putting my posts through the crucible of r/programming. To stray from this prerogative would be to Betray and Disgust my target audience: the programmers, the tech-inclined, the numerate. The people who followed the same sorts of blogs as I did, I suppose. This audience was mostly imaginary, but for a while they nevertheless remained my target, and I mostly stuck to writing technical blog posts that programmers could stick their teeth into.</p>
<p>Over time, I've relaxed this stance a little, allowing myself to stray into book reviews, data dives, and personal reflections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why I've strayed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="unfinished">Unfinished</h4>
<p>This is partly because I've become less bothered about sharing my writing. While there's undoubtedly a rush from seeing people read and discuss what I write, there's a negative side to it, too. Due to the undercurrent of one-upmanship and um-ackshually-ing that exists in computer culture, it can be somewhat unpleasant to share one's thoughts in tech spaces if you don't have a thick skin.</p>
<p>For example, my first ever article was about a simulation to show that boarding a plane could be faster if the entrances were closer to the center of the plane. One of the top comments in the Reddit discussion thread went something like "actually, most of the time is spent waiting to even start the boarding, so this whole article is pointless!". I love the blogging culture in tech, but it seems that </p>
<p>Anyway, this isn't meant to be a rant about tech culture. This is supposed to be a rant about WHAT SHOULD GO ON MY BLOG
- "This is cool and all, but here's my project that's much better."
- "The humorous tone of the article went over my head so now I'm going to insult you for this thing that I took entirely too seriously."
- "I'm going to get hung up on this small detail in paragraph 5, line 3. There's no forest here, only trees!"</p>
<p>As of now, the most pressing topic I feel the need to write into existence and vomit onto the internet is my experience of doing the Camino de Santiago, and also the Recurse Center. More for myself than anything - besides sharing the memories and experience with others, I want to take the opportunity to reflect and think back on those times. Then there's the old impulse to write technical content: my experience so far with programmatic art and a tutorial for <a href="https://github.com/vydd/sketch">Sketch</a>, the graphics playground I've been using &amp; contributing to.</p>
<p>SOMEWHERE: sense of closure for projects that comes from writing a blog post. It's a deliverable, and gives visibility to the project.</p>
<p>That's all. Hopefully this gives my imaginary audience, and myself, a more solid idea of the nature of this blog.</p>
