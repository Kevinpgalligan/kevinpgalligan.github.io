        <title>George Carlin&#39;s Things You Never See, AI edition</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The comedian George Carlin had a bit known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X0F1Qjn0Ac&#34;&gt;Things You Never See&lt;/a&gt;, where he listed off a series of things you never see or hear (or want to hear) in day-to-day life. Things like a wheelchair with a roll cage, or someone telling their dad that he should drink more. It occurred to me that these would serve as amusing prompts for AI image generation, while giving me an opportunity to play around with the latest trendy AI tools. Continue reading to see the results!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; The prompts and resulting images are NOT SUITABLE FOR WORK. After all, George Carlin&#39;s comedy was so controversial that it sparked a court case about the US government&#39;s right to censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-setup&#34;&gt;The setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first looked into DALL-E and Bing Image Creator, both of which offer web interfaces for inputting prompts and getting back AI-generated images. DALL-E turned out to be paywalled, however, while Bing Image Creator censors any &#34;indecent material&#34; in the prompts. So, defeated by The Man, I turned to Stable Diffusion (SD), an open source image-generating AI that can be run by anyone with a GPU and patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to jump between various guides to get SD to work. I&#39;m not going to link a particular guide, because none of them contained all the information I needed. The steps can be summarised as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the weights/parameters for the SD neural network. The weights file for the latest version (1.4) is about 4GB in size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion&#34;&gt;SD repository&lt;/a&gt; from GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download Anaconda, which is used to build an environment in which you can run SD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up the environment using Anaconda. Normally, this is a 1-line command, but I had to figure out how to save the dependencies to a different hard drive because my main one didn&#39;t have enough free space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run SD using the script &lt;code&gt;scripts/txt2img.py&lt;/code&gt; from the repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another roadblock I hit was that my GPU (GeForce GTX 1050 Ti) has only 4GB of memory, while 6GB is normally required to run SD. Thankfully, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/basujindal/stable-diffusion/tree/main&#34;&gt;fork exists&lt;/a&gt; to run SD with lower memory requirements. It provides a version of &lt;code&gt;txt2img.py&lt;/code&gt; that breaks the GPU computations into multiple stages, allowing you to get away with around 2.5GB of GPU memory. In exchange, you have to wait longer for results, and it took my computer over 1 minute to generate each image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-results&#34;&gt;The results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlin&#39;s jokes and the corresponding images are shown below. The jokes are in italics, while my comments are not. I edited the text of each joke to make it more prompt-like before passing it to SD. For &#34;things you never hear&#34;, I generally passed the dialogue by itself, quote marks included. All the images were originally generated at a resolution of 512x512, since the output was terrible when I used 256x256. Finally, a suggestion: the images may look better if you squint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never see a Rolls-Royce with a bumper sticker that says &#34;shit happens&#34;.&lt;/em&gt; It looks like a fancy car, but no bumper sticker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/rolls-royce.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;What might be a cyan-coloured Rolls-Royce, but no bumper sticker.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never see a really big tall fat Chinese guy with red hair.&lt;/em&gt; Those symbols resemble Chinese characters, right? But he doesn&#39;t have red hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/chinese-guy.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A large nipple-less man who looks vaguely Chinese, beside what might pass as Chinese characters. He doesn&#39;t have red hair, though.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never see a wheelchair with a roll bar.&lt;/em&gt; No roll bar!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/wheelchair.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A woman in a normal wheelchair.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never see someone taking a shit while running at full speed.&lt;/em&gt; I used a more explicit prompt to generate the second image, since I thought the first one didn&#39;t live up to its full comedic potential. Note how the floor got turned into poop. I kindly censored the naked runner&#39;s weird smooth crotch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/shit-while-running.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A runner on tarmac, who doesn&#39;t appear to be defecating.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/shit-while-running-2.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A naked runner, whose head is out of frame, running on a floor of poop.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never see a picture of Margaret Thatcher strapping on a dildo.&lt;/em&gt; I generated a second one because I thought it was funny. Hopefully it&#39;s okay to do this, given that she&#39;s dead? He told the joke while she was alive, so...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/thatcher-1.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;Margaret Thatcher holding what appears to be a cross between a dildo and a microphone.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/thatcher-2.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;Margaret Thatcher holding a vaguely penis-like object.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never hear someone say &#34;Dad, you really ought to drink more&#34;.&lt;/em&gt; The first of the lame &#34;you never hear...&#34; prompts, although it&#39;s funny to imagine the baby whispering that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/dad.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A man holding his baby. A yelloe-coloured caption contains nonsense letters that vaguely resemble the prompt.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never hear someone say &#34;Do what you want to the girl, but leave me alone&#34;.&lt;/em&gt; It seems that SD didn&#39;t understand the context of this prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/do-what-you-want.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;Nonsense text in Impact font, vaguely resembling the prompt. And the back of someone&#39;s head.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never hear someone say &#34;As soon as I put this hot poker in my ass I&#39;m going to chop my dick off&#34;.&lt;/em&gt; The guy looks appropriately serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/hot-poker.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A man wearing a green bandana, a shirt, and a gold bracelet that looks obviously Photoshopped. He has stubble, his face is a bit flushed, and he has an intense expression on his face. He&#39;s holding long object that might be a poker, it weirdly disappears into his right nostril. He might also be holding a knife in the same hand.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never hear someone say &#34;Honey, let&#39;s sell the children, move to Zanzibar, and begin taking opium rectally&#34;.&lt;/em&gt; Hm, is this what Zanzibar looks like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/honey-lets-sell.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A Black family sitting on a beach under some palm trees, their faces are quite messed up and their bodies are disconnected / intersecting with the trees.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never hear someone say &#34;Mom, I&#39;ve got a big date tonight, can I borrow a French tickler from you?&#34;.&lt;/em&gt; The disembodied hand is quite funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/french-tickler.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A woman in a skimpy pink dress sitting on a bed, she&#39;s holding a disembodied hand and kissing the thumb, also holding a knife-like object and a metal rod.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don&#39;t want to come home and hear &#34;Honey, remember how we told the children never to play on the railroad tracks?&#34;.&lt;/em&gt; These children are creepy as hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/railroad-tracks.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;Demon children looking happy and sitting on railroad tracks.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don&#39;t want to be sitting in your doctor&#39;s office and hear &#34;Well Jim, there&#39;s no reason why you shouldn&#39;t live another 20 to 30 years. However, you will be bleeding constantly from both eyes&#34;.&lt;/em&gt; I could probably pick a better prompt to show someone bleeding from their eyes, but I don&#39;t particularly feel like doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/eyebleed.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A serious-looking balding man, lots of nonsensical meme letters.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don&#39;t want to hear &#34;I&#39;M PREGNANT, YOU&#39;RE THE FATHER, AND I&#39;M GOING TO KILL ALL 3 OF US!&#34;&lt;/em&gt; Liking the intensity with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/pregnant.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;An intense, angry-looking woman whose mouth is wide open. There are weird black holes in her eyes, nostrils and mouth. Also, once again, there&#39;s nonsensical meme text.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don&#39;t want to hear &#34;Honey, it&#39;s the police. They have a search warrant and the 300 kilos of cocaine are still sitting out in the living room.&#34;&lt;/em&gt; This is quite good, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/honey-police.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;Police officers kneeling down and inspecting a bunch of bags of white powder, scattered across a wooden floor. A TV with a cracked screen is in the background. The officers are missing their eyes and their faces are all blurred / contorted.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don&#39;t want to hear your fiancé say &#34;I&#39;ll be right back, I&#39;ve gotta take a dump&#34; while the two of you are having dinner together with your parents for the first time.&lt;/em&gt; I don&#39;t know what the hell this is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/dump.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;That Willy Wonka meme where he&#39;s leaning on his elbow, except someone else is badly superimposed over him. Again, there&#39;s meme text.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing around with SD has made me appreciate the abilities and limitations of current image AIs. As far as I can tell, it takes a lot of thought and a lot of hardware power to get satisfactory results. Regarding the George Carlin prompts, I don&#39;t think they were explicit enough to generate the images I was hoping for, particularly the ones in the &#34;things you don&#39;t hear&#34; category. SD doesn&#39;t seem to be smart enough to pick up on the context of dialogue, and requires a direct description. Also, for some reason, putting the prompt in quotes tends to result in the addition of meme text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s all for now! If I were to continue experimenting with SD, then I would try out the many tools and interfaces that people have built around it to help generate better images. There&#39;s also the option to base the output on a source image.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>I submitted my thesis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, after 4 years of toil, I &lt;strong&gt;SUBMITTED MY PHD THESIS&lt;/strong&gt;. The only thing left to do is my thesis defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How PhDs work in Ireland is that you defend your thesis in front of two examiners: one internal and one external. The internal examiner is from your home university, while the external examiner is from another university and is supposed to give a more objective appraisal. They&#39;re both regular researchers who volunteer to assess you. Why? I don&#39;t know. Probably as a favour to your supervisor, or as a networking opportunity. Or maybe they&#39;re just crazy. Anyway, they grill you about your research for a couple of hours, and then, assuming everything goes well, and after you&#39;ve addressed any corrections they might suggest, you walk away with a doctorate. My thesis defence will be some time in the next 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still processing how I feel about all this. It has been almost 1 year since my last blog post, and I&#39;m not sure how the gap became so long. I guess my enthusiasm for writing in my spare time was sapped by the apprehension of the submission deadline. I&#39;ve done some hobby programming, but mostly I&#39;ve been in zombie mode, stumbling step-by-step towards a completed thesis. I did a 3-month research placement in Boston from February to May, whipped together one last paper, submitted it to a conference, and then stitched all of my completed research into a 100-page document that I will soon have to present before my hopefully sympathetic examiners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have an abundance of free time, I&#39;m going to get back into blog-writing and code-wrangling. The intention of this post was to mark the occasion, and to mark a new beginning. In the near future, expect to see posts on the following topics: fluctuations in chess ratings, triangulation pillars in Ireland, and a PhD retrospective. Hopefully, I will also become more active in the programming space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Get involved in open source software by using it</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Beginner software developers often ask this question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can someone tell me a good open source project to work on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if someone suggests a project to work on, why would our hypothetical beginner, a burgeoning Linus Torvalds, care about a random project that someone pulled from their hat? It probably won&#39;t have any personal relevance to them. They probably won&#39;t know what it&#39;s for or how it works. In addition, big popular projects tend to have massive codebases with tens of thousands of lines of code, which could very well baffle a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me suggest instead that if you want to get involved in open source software, &lt;em&gt;use it&lt;/em&gt;. My experience is that by using software, I have an idea of how it works. I already know something about the domain in which the software operates. The software is useful to me personally, so I&#39;m motivated to fix it and improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One type of open source software you might already use is the desktop application: Firefox, the GNOME calculator, tmux, various IRC clients, GIMP, vim. These are all applications that I use regularly, and if I encounter a bug in any of them, I&#39;m motivated to fix it. For example: I &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hexchat/hexchat/issues/2394#issuecomment-748543455&#34;&gt;tried (and failed) to patch a bug&lt;/a&gt; in the HexChat IRC application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with applications is that they generally have massive codebases. You won&#39;t necessarily be familiar with the programming language they use, and they require getting tangled up in application programming. You&#39;ll have to learn about GUI frameworks, how applications interact with operating systems, and other things that may or may not interest you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&#39;s another way: use open source libraries in your own projects. You know, the same projects that you&#39;re doing to learn programming and to pad your CV. You will inevitably need to make use of code that other people have written. You will inevitably run into problems with that code, or identify a missing feature, at which point you can dig in and solve it yourself. The good thing is that you&#39;re motivated to solve the problem because it&#39;s your problem and it&#39;s blocking your project. Maybe you&#39;ll become particularly interested in one of these libraries and you can become actively involved in its development. And then all of a sudden you will have become an open source developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tip. The more niche the software you&#39;re using, the fewer eyes will be on the code and the more opportunity there will be to take things into your own hands. Using a popular Python package, there will be hundreds of people waiting to jump in and fix bugs. But for that Common Lisp package that only a dozen people use, you might be the only one who has experienced a particular bug, and you might be the only one who can fix it. For example, I contributed bugfixes to two Common Lisp libraries, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cl-model-languages/cl-sat/pull/5&#34;&gt;cl-sat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Shinmera/random-state/pull/8&#34;&gt;random-state&lt;/a&gt;, which I used in projects that I have described on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For experienced developers, let&#39;s stop recommending that new programmers launch themselves at large codebases and read them like a novel. &lt;a href=&#34;https://gigamonkeys.com/code-reading/&#34;&gt;Nobody does that anyway&lt;/a&gt;. I still remember when I was learning Python through (and in spite of) the book Learning Python the Hard Way. The author recommended spending 1 week reading the codebase of a big web framework like Flask. 1 week was an annoyingly arbitrary timeframe, the objective of the task was not clear, and I didn&#39;t have a clue what a web framework was or what it was good for. My young self sensibly skipped the exercise. It&#39;s not like asking a journeyman painter to go to an art museum and learn from the work of the masters. We learn from the code of others by building a mental model of the problem in our head and then seeing the language idioms they used to solve it, not by aimlessly browsing their code with no idea what it&#39;s doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Board games and Markov chains</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Children of a certain age are drawn to mindless board games like Snakes &amp;amp; Ladders, which involve no skill or decision-making or social engineering or anything that a reasonable human might associate with the word &#34;fun&#34;. The outcome is determined entirely by chance, in the form of dice rolls. The only pleasure I can imagine being derived from such games is the trickle of dopamine that comes from winning and the schadenfreude that comes from seeing a snake devour your opponent, which in my considered opinion is setting children up to become inveterate gamblers and psychopaths, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that may be the case, there may be one redeeming aspect to these games, which is that they can be analysed using simple tools from probability. The state of the game, such as the position of the players, changes each round based on the output of a random number generator, such as a die 🎲. The next state depends only on the random output and the current state. This is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain&#34;&gt;Markov process&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be analysed using nothing more than some matrix math!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate what a Markov process (or Markov chain) is, let&#39;s consider a simple board game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/boardgame/boardgame.png&#34;
     alt=&#34;A simple board game with 3 positions (A, B and C) and a 6-sided die.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The best board game ever.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has 3 squares: the start square A, the middle square B, and the end square C. Each turn, you roll a 6-sided die. If 1 comes up, you move back to A or stay on it if you&#39;re already there. If 2-5 come up, you advance to the next square. If 6 comes up, you go straight to C, no matter which square you&#39;re currently on. Once you&#39;re at C, the game is over and the state doesn&#39;t change anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The states of the Markov chain that corresponds to this board game, and the probability of moving from one state to another (the transition probability), can be visualised as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/boardgame/chain.png&#34;
     alt=&#34;The Markov chain corresponding to the example board game. There are 3 states: A, B and C. There are arrows between the states, labelled with the probability of going from one state to another.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Markov chain corresponding to that board game.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circles are the states, which represent which square you&#39;re on. The arrows are labelled with the transition probability from one state to another. Based on the rules above, the transition probabilities for state A are: 1/6 to A, 4/6 to B, and 1/6 to C. They add up to 1/6 + 1/6 + 4/6 = 1, which makes sense because those are all the possible options and the probability of all possible options must be 1. From state B, there is a 1/6 chance of going back to A and a 5/6 chance of going to C, and 1/6 + 5/6 = 1. Finally, the probability of staying in C once you reach it is 1, because at that point the game is over.&lt;/p&gt;

The same applies to the other states. It alllllll makes sense when you multiply it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these newfound powers, we can plot the probability distribution of being in any of the states on a given turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Probability distribution of being in state A, B or C on each turn.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The probability of being in the end state, C, very quickly converges to 1. It&#39;s a short game. But how many turns should we expect it to take for the game to end? Will the game be over in time for tea, or will we be driven to blow our brains out by the pointless monotony of it all? This can be resolved using... linear algebra&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:algebra&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; href=&#34;#fn:algebra&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

Solving this system of equations for our example game gives &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;μ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;A&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2.3&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;\mu_A=2.3&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;msupsub&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-t vlist-t2&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.32833099999999993em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pstrut&#34; style=&#34;height:2.7em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal mtight&#34;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-s&#34;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.15em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;2.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;μ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;B&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1.39&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;\mu_B=1.39&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;msupsub&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-t vlist-t2&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.32833099999999993em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pstrut&#34; style=&#34;height:2.7em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal mtight&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.05017em;&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-s&#34;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.15em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;1.39&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Homework for the reader: verify this result by hand or by plugging the equations into a linear algebra solver of your choice. Or, grab a die, play the game a bunch of times, track how many turns each game takes, and average them afterwards to get an estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The techniques I&#39;ve covered here also apply to Snakes &amp;amp; Ladders, Monopoly (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubQXz5RBBtU&amp;amp;t=904s&#34;&gt;which are the best properties to buy?&lt;/a&gt;), the number of times you need to flip a coin before getting 5 heads in a row, and any other situation that can be modelled as a Markov process!&lt;/p&gt;

I wrote it in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jsoftware.com&#34;&gt;J programming language&lt;/a&gt;, which is (in)famous for looking like gobbledygook if you&#39;re not familiar with it.

        <title>I love ads!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t owned a television in 10 years. It was only during the COVID-19 pandemic, after moving home to live with my parents, that I became reacquainted with television advertising. During that time, I was exposed to the background hum of television on a daily basis. It was always there. Crooning to me as I sat down for dinner. Whispering in my ear as I fell asleep. Shouting at me as I left the room in search of quiet. Jumping up and down at my knee, begging for attention. It&#39;s the ad, ad-vert, ad-ver-tisement. 15 minutes for every hour of TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I resisted this new source of distraction. I use ad-blocking software for a reason, I thought. Ads aren&#39;t good for your brain, and they&#39;re for suckers. I would be happy if I never saw another ad for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O, what a fool I was. For 10 years - 10 long years! - I rejected the comforting embrace of the marketer, cast out the copywriter, and declined to break bread with the ad executive. I, a sociable animal, turned my back on good society. It&#39;s incredible to me now that I could ever have been so cruel to myself. That I could withdraw from the warm glow of the ad, when it&#39;s the nature of humans to seek warmth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But worry not, my friend, for the wandering lamb has returned to the fold. After prolonged exposure to TV marketing, I have hit upon a wonderful revelation. And the revelation is this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I love ads!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a trillion-dollar industry with the best of intentions. Rank upon smiling rank of ad executive, writer, creative director, smart-talker, smart-walker and CEO - all happily working away to construct a targeted message that&#39;s just for me. They dress in suits and congregate in glass towers, like an ancient, benevolent order of robe-clad monks who sit at church in fervent prayer, sending good vibes my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are difficult times, but it is of great comfort to me to know that such a powerful force for good is out there in the world, with only my best interest at heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O cruel, needless misunderstanding! O stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast! But it is all right now. Everything is all right, the struggle is finished. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four&#34;&gt;I have won the victory over myself&lt;/a&gt;. I love ads.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Advent of Code 2021</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I got bitten quite badly by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2021&#34;&gt;Advent of Code 2021&lt;/a&gt; (AoC 2021) bug, and ended up solving all the problems in Common Lisp. Here&#39;s a short, long-delayed review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you don&#39;t know, Advent of Code is a programming competition where a new problem is released every day in the lead-up to Christmas, just like an advent calendar. The competitors are ranked according to how quickly they submit their solutions. I wasn&#39;t competing, and only finished the problems in late January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my linecounts for each of the 25 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/aoc2021/linecount.png&#34;
     alt=&#34;Line counts by day. They range from about 10 lines to about 250 lines.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the later problems took more lines of code, because they were more difficult, but this wasn&#39;t universally true. I massively over-engineered some of the later problems, and went outside the scope of others. &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/24&#34;&gt;Day 24&lt;/a&gt; includes the specification of a simple processing unit, for example, which I went ahead and implemented (unnecessarily). I also went completely overboard with &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/17&#34;&gt;day 17&lt;/a&gt;, which tasks you with calculating the trajectory of a projectile, and wrote a toy equation solver. Also bloating the line count is the fact that I usually copied helper functions between files rather than packaging them up for re-use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common Lisp was pleasant to use. It doesn&#39;t come with as many batteries as Python, but even Python users who are taking the competition seriously (like &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.vero.site/post/advent-leaderboard&#34;&gt;this person&lt;/a&gt;) will want to have their own data structures and algorithms library to-hand. It shouldn&#39;t be too much of a burden on top of that to implement simple functions like &lt;code&gt;(read-lines file)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(split-string string)&lt;/code&gt;. Speaking of &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.vero.site/post/advent-leaderboard&#34;&gt;that person&lt;/a&gt;, who happens to be the winner of AoC 2021, their post confirmed some of my ideas about what it would take to be competitive with the rest of the internet: lots of practice, a personal library that you know like the back of your hand, and automation software to download the problems at midnight and submit the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only day I really struggled with was &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/19&#34;&gt;#19&lt;/a&gt;, which required knowledge about 3d rotations that I just didn&#39;t have. I ended up asking the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/s83n99/2021_day_19common_lisp_is_my_algorithm_wrong_or/&#34;&gt;sages of reddit&lt;/a&gt; for assistance. Oh, and I had a nasty bug on &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/18&#34;&gt;day 18&lt;/a&gt;, which was not triggered by the sample input. To debug it, I ended up taking someone else&#39;s solution, printing the data structure at each step of their code, and comparing the output to mine, which made it obvious what the bug was. Those were a rough 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t need graphviz to solve &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/12&#34;&gt;day 12&lt;/a&gt;, but it was cool to be able to visualise the cave (see below). Data formats in general are cool and powerful! If you know &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm#PPM_example&#34;&gt;PPM&lt;/a&gt;, for example, which is a simple ASCII storage format for images, then it&#39;s easy to visualise the output of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raytracing.github.io/&#34;&gt;toy ray tracer&lt;/a&gt; in any language, because you just have to save a list of numbers to a file. With graphviz, you can easily visualise graphs in any language by writing a 5-line function that saves your graph data structure to a file in a very simple format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/aoc2021/graph.svg&#34;
     alt=&#34;Graph of the cave from day 12, it&#39;s just circles and lines connecting them.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t plan to participate next year, but it&#39;s a nice thing to do if you want to get your hands dirty with a programming language. After the competition, I felt like I could blast out code in Common Lisp fairly fluently (though still not as fluently as Python). I&#39;m pretty sure I went through a similar process with Python, back in the day, when I was solving programming challenges to prepare for interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my solutions are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/advent-of-code-2021&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, if anyone wants to take a peek.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Making a calculator</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve released a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/ka&#34;&gt;calculator language&lt;/a&gt;, codenamed &lt;em&gt;ka&lt;/em&gt;! It can do quick one-off calculations from the command line (such as &lt;code&gt;ka &#39;9*9&#39;&lt;/code&gt;), or it can be run as a command line interpreter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ka
ka version 1.0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 2 * (1/2)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also has a crappy work-in-progress graphical interface, which can be summoned by running &lt;code&gt;ka --gui&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/ka/gui.png&#34;
     alt=&#34;ka GUI, which basically consists of a single line to enter expressions and a white text area where the results are printed.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;In which Kevin learns the frustrations of GUI programming.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to make a calculator because I found myself sometimes using Python as a calculator (for scipy&#39;s math functions), sometimes using the desktop calculator that comes with Linux Mint (for convenience), sometimes using the Common Lisp REPL (for its first-class support of fractions), sometimes using web calculators. I wanted all the functionality that I commonly use to be available in one, convenient package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that needs work, if I want anyone besides myself to actually be able to use ka, is the packaging. I haven&#39;t tested how easy it is to install from scratch, but a Linux user would need to (1) install the Qt 5 GUI framework using their package manager of choice, (2) use pip to install the ka-cli package from the Python Package Index, and (3) add an entry to their desktop configuration so that they can run ka as a standalone application rather than having to start up a terminal every time. Ideally, this would all be done by an installer, but I haven&#39;t packaged an application for Linux before and I&#39;m too lazy to learn how. And let&#39;s not talk about Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting things about ka on the language level are its&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turing-incompleteness (no loops or conditionals), which is fine for a calculator language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will briefly discuss each of these points!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve decided not to add loops or if statements or many features of Real Programming Languages because it seems like unnecessary bloat for a calculator. I did want to include support for variables, however, because otherwise certain common calculations would be a pain in the neck and I&#39;d have to go crawling back to Python all the time. If a calculation truly requires loops or conditionals, well then maybe it should be done using a Real Programming Language after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s kinda interesting how the unit system works. The language has a Quantity type, which consists of (1) a magnitude and (2) a unit. &#34;5 metres&#34; is a quantity whose magnitude is 5 and whose unit is, well, the metre. Quantities that measure the same physical characteristic (such as &#39;length&#39;) can be added and subtracted. It doesn&#39;t make sense to add quantities that measure different things, like &#39;area&#39; and &#39;velocity&#39;. Any quantities can be multipled or divided together, however. For example: if you know that a bath&#39;s volume is &lt;code&gt;V=3 metres^3&lt;/code&gt;, and it&#39;s filling up at rate &lt;code&gt;r=0.01 metre^3 | second&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;V/r&lt;/code&gt; gives the time in seconds until the bath fills up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally, all the units are derived from the 7 &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit&#34;&gt;SI base units&lt;/a&gt;. The newton, the unit of force, is written in terms of base units as &lt;code&gt;kilogram ⋅ metre ⋅ second^-2&lt;/code&gt;. I&#39;m not sure where I got the idea (probably while skimming the Wikipedia page on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis&#34;&gt;dimensional analysis&lt;/a&gt;), but I coded this up by storing the integer exponent of each base unit in a 7-dimensional vector. If the 1st dimension is devoted to kilograms, and the 2nd dimension to metres, and the 4th dimension to seconds, then the newton&#39;s vector representation would be &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;1, 1, 0, -2, 0, 0, 0&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you multiply two quantities, their vectors are added together to make a new quantity. When you divide them, the second one is subtracted from the first. So, returning to the bathtub example, the volume would have a vector representation of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the rate would be &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;0, 3, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;V/r&lt;/code&gt; would be &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;0, 3-3, 0, 0-(-1), 0, 0, 0&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, or just &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (seconds). Units can also come with a multiplier (the foot is a multiple of the metre) or an offset (the degree Celcius is offset from the kelvin). And they can have prefixes that apply a multiple: kilo multiplies by 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, centi multiplies by 10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. That&#39;s about it for units! Though of course, there are some edge cases, such as the kilogram being the only base unit with a prefix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type system is strongly typed, which means it complains when you pass a Fraction to a function that expects an Integer. There are basically two types of types: numeric types, which are arranged in the hierarchy Real &amp;lt; Fraction &amp;lt; Integer, and a Quantity type all on its own. An Integer can pass as a Real, because it&#39;s further down the hierarchy, but not vice versa. I got the type hierarchy idea from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP). Another trick I stole from SICP: if a Fraction can be simplified to an Integer, then this is done automatically, so that &lt;code&gt;6/2&lt;/code&gt; is always simplified to &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;. The implementation language of ka is Python, and the fact that Python has a module for &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html&#34;&gt;fractions&lt;/a&gt; and a module for &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html&#34;&gt;numeric types&lt;/a&gt; made my work on the type system a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there you have it. A calculator language in about 1400 lines of Python code. If anyone happens to read this and happens to try out ka, I&#39;d be curious to hear how you get on with it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Yet another Wordle solver</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Like everyone and their dog, I&#39;ve been playing Wordle. And like everyone and their dog, I&#39;ve written a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/yet-another-wordle-solver&#34;&gt;Wordle solver&lt;/a&gt;. Details below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, a quick introduction to the game. If you haven&#39;t come across it yet, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/&#34;&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt; is a language puzzle game. You have 6 guesses to find a secret 5-letter word. Every time you make a guess, you are told which letters are in the correct position, which letters are correct but in the wrong position, and which letters are incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example below, our first guess is WORDY. The letters &#39;R&#39; and &#39;D&#39; are highlighted in yellow, which means that they&#39;re in the secret word somewhere, but not in those positions. The remaining letters (&#39;W&#39;, &#39;O&#39; and &#39;Y&#39;), are greyed out, which means that they&#39;re not in the secret word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/wordle/example.png&#34;
     alt=&#34;Wordle example where the first three guesses are WORDY, DRAPE and ELDER. ELDER turns out to be the correct word.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use that information about the secret word to form our next guess, DRAPE, which tells us that there&#39;s an &#39;E&#39; in the secret word, in addition to the &#39;R&#39; and &#39;D&#39;. Finally, we guess ELDER, which turns out to be the correct word. All the letters are highlighted in green, which means they&#39;re all in the correct position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Wordle solver (let&#39;s call it YAWS for short - Yet Another Wordle Solver) is simple. It keeps a list of possible secret words, starting with all 2315 words in Wordle&#39;s dictionary. It removes words from the list after each guess, according to the hints it receives. If the solver knows that the secret word begins with &#39;e&#39;, for example, it can remove all words that don&#39;t begin with &#39;e&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does YAWS pick the next word to guess? It picks the word that, on average, rules out as many secret words as possible. If we expect there to be an average of 61 possible secret words left after guessing &#39;raise&#39;, then it&#39;s a better guess than &#39;album&#39;, which leaves an average of 254 possible secret words, and so YAWS picks &#39;raise&#39; over &#39;album&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very Slightly More Formally, let&#39;s say &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;S&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.05764em;&#34;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the set of possible secret words, &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;G&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;G&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the set of allowed guesses (of which there are around 12 thousand), &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;X&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;X&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.07847em;&#34;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the actual secret word (which is random), and &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;g&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo separator=&#34;true&#34;&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;X&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo separator=&#34;true&#34;&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;r(g, X, S)&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.02778em;&#34;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03588em;&#34;&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mpunct&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.07847em;&#34;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mpunct&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.05764em;&#34;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the new set of possible secret words after we guess the word &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;g&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;g&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03588em;&#34;&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Note that &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;r&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.02778em;&#34;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is a function of &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;X&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;X&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.07847em;&#34;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;S&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.05764em;&#34;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as well as &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;g&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;g&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03588em;&#34;&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, since it depends both on what possibilities are left and on the actual secret word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next word picked by YAWS is given by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is just the original explanation in (crappy) maths notation. We &lt;em&gt;minimise&lt;/em&gt; (using &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arg_max&#34;&gt;argmin&lt;/a&gt;) the &lt;em&gt;expected size&lt;/em&gt; (E[|...|]) of the new set of secret words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, we only keep secret words that return the same hint as the true secret word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is great! We&#39;ve fully specified how YAWS &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm&#34;&gt;greedily&lt;/a&gt; picks the best next guess. The only problem is complexity. Let&#39;s say that the size of &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;G&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;G&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the size of &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;S&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.05764em;&#34;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are both proportional to a number &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;n&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. YAWS has to loop over all possible guesses, which is &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&#34;script&#34;&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;\mathcal{O}(n)&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathcal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.02778em;&#34;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; complexity. For each guess, it has to check all possible secrets, which is also &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&#34;script&#34;&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;\mathcal{O}(n)&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathcal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.02778em;&#34;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; complexity. And for each secret, it has to loop over all the other secrets to figure out which ones will be in the new set of secrets, which is - you guessed it - &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&#34;script&#34;&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;\mathcal{O}(n)&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathcal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.02778em;&#34;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; complexity. Overall, that makes it an &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&#34;script&#34;&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;3&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;\mathcal{O}(n^3)&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1.064108em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathcal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.02778em;&#34;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;msupsub&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-t&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.8141079999999999em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pstrut&#34; style=&#34;height:2.7em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mtight&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; algorithm, which is verrrrryyyy slow for Wordle&#39;s &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;≈&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;10000&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;n \approx 10000&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.48312em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;≈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;10000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better approach is to group the secrets based on the hint they will return for a given guess &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;g&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;g&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03588em;&#34;&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Then we don&#39;t need to loop over the secrets a third time, because we already know which secrets give the same hint. This makes the complexity &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1.064108em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.02778em;&#34;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;msupsub&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-t&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.8141079999999999em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pstrut&#34; style=&#34;height:2.7em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mtight&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Here&#39;s the improved algorithm in Python pseudocode.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ow&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;buckets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;buckets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ow&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that handwavey explanation didn&#39;t lose you completely, here are the results! This is the number of guesses made by YAWS when it&#39;s tested on all possible secret words, with its first guess being RAISE. I&#39;ve compared it to my first 28 Wordle scores.&lt;/p&gt;

     alt=&#34;My performance vs the solver&#39;s performance.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YAWS gets a score of 3 much more consistently than I do, and it never makes more than 5 guesses. It makes an average (mean) of 3.495 guesses, which is pretty close to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.poirrier.ca/notes/wordle-optimal/&#34;&gt;the best possible average&lt;/a&gt; (3.4212). Not bad for a greedy algorithm. For a description of the optimal Wordle algorithm, I would recommend checking out &lt;a href=&#34;sonorouschocolate.com/notes/index.php?title=The_best_strategies_for_Wordle&#34;&gt;this write-up&lt;/a&gt;, which is where I nicked some of the maths notation that I used above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing. Here&#39;s a graph of letter frequency among the Wordle secret words. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etaoin_shrdlu&#34;&gt;ETAOIN SHRDLU&lt;/a&gt; is often used as a mnemonic to remember the most commonly used letters in the English language, but for Wordle it looks like that should be EAROT LISNCU.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The probability of a hash collision</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function&#34;&gt;hash function&lt;/a&gt; takes arbitrarily complex input - a word, a website, an image, a human being - and maps it to a single number. This is useful for various computer science stuffs, such as data storage and cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let&#39;s say you want to store a book in one of &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;N&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;N&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.10903em;&#34;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; boxes. If you put the book in a random box, it&#39;s quite likely that you&#39;ll forget which box you picked, especially as &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;N&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;N&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.10903em;&#34;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gets bigger. What you can do instead is apply a hash function to the title of the book (probably &lt;em&gt;The Notebook&lt;/em&gt;, knowing you), which will spit out a number, &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;i&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.65952em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. You then put your book in the &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;i&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.65952em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-th box&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:modulo&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; href=&#34;#fn:modulo&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. When you want to retrieve &lt;em&gt;The Notebook&lt;/em&gt; again, you recompute the hash function and it tells you to look in the &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;i&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.65952em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-th box, without you needing to remember where you stored anything! You won&#39;t lose a book from your Nicholas Sparks collection ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won&#39;t get into the specifics of what a hash function looks like. This post is instead concerned with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_collision&#34;&gt;hash collisions&lt;/a&gt;, which happen when your hash function assigns the same value to two different items. This might be a Bad Thing. Our hash function wouldn&#39;t be very useful, for instance, if it told us to put all our books in the 1st box, because we&#39;d have to spend a lot of time rooting around in that box to find a specific book&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:unique&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; href=&#34;#fn:unique&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For this reason, a good hash function should have evenly distributed outputs. But even then, it&#39;s only a matter of time before a hash collision occurs as we add more and more books to our collection. By the time we reach &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;N&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;N+1&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.76666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.10903em;&#34;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mbin&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; books, there won&#39;t enough boxes to store the books individually and there will definitely be at least 1 hash collision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;N&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;N&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.10903em;&#34;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; boxes and &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;k&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; books, how do you figure out the &lt;em&gt;probability&lt;/em&gt; of a hash collision? Hash collisions can be a Bad Thing, but rather than trying to eliminate them entirely (an impossible task), you might instead buy enough boxes that the probability of a hash collision is relatively low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Preshing wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://preshing.com/20110504/hash-collision-probabilities/&#34;&gt;neat article&lt;/a&gt; on how to calculate hash collision probabilities, but there are some gaps in his explanation. This is my attempt to fill those gaps. To follow along you&#39;ll need a basic understanding of probability and an iron will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-birthday-problem&#34;&gt;The Birthday Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following problem statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you compute the hash values of 500 different book titles from your magnificent book collection, and put each book into the corresponding box in a row of 100,000 boxes (yes, it&#39;s a lot of boxes), what&#39;s the probability that at least 2 books will be in the same box? (~71.3%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you put 50 balls into 100 buckets at random, what&#39;s the probability that at least 2 balls will end up in the same bucket? (~99.99997%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When there are 30 people in a room, what&#39;s the probability that at least 2 of them will share a birthday? (~70.6%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all versions of the notorious &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem&#34;&gt;birthday problem&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s notorious because it&#39;s not immediately intuitive why the probabilities are so high. The key is that even though there are only 50 balls in problem #2, there are 1225 &lt;em&gt;pairs&lt;/em&gt; of balls, and only one of those pairs needs to be in the same bucket. Problems #1 and #3 have the exact same structure. In problem #1, you can think of the books as balls and the boxes as buckets, and in problem #3, the people are balls and the days of the year are buckets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of calculating hash collision probabilities IS the birthday problem. Let&#39;s look at how to solve the birthday problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;exact-calculation-of-birthday-probability&#34;&gt;Exact calculation of birthday probability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To calculate the exact probability of two or more people sharing a birthday in a room of &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;k&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; people, it&#39;s easiest to first figure out the probability of &lt;em&gt;none of them&lt;/em&gt; sharing a birthday. In this case, &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;N&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;365&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;N=365&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.10903em;&#34;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;365&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, since instead of boxes there are 365 possible birthdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first person to enter the room has probability&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And... that&#39;s it. That&#39;s the EXACT probability of a hash collision for &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;k&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; items and &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;N&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;N&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.10903em;&#34;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; possible hash function outputs! All right, pack your bags and go home. Nothing more to see here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But actually, this formula gets clunky as &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;N&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;N&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.10903em;&#34;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;k&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; get big. Imagine you have 1 billion books. Do you really want to multiply 1 billion numbers together? I bet not. Even a computer will take a long time to multiply 1 billion numbers. For this reason, approximations of the formula are often used, as we will see next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;e-asy-approximation&#34;&gt;e-asy approximation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first approximation of the hash collision probability can be derived by rewriting equation (1) so that the terms in the product are written as complements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last equality comes from the fact that &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&#34;normal&#34;&gt;.&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&#34;normal&#34;&gt;.&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&#34;normal&#34;&gt;.&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&#34;normal&#34;&gt;/&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;1+2+...+n=n(n+1)/2&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.72777em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mbin&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.72777em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mbin&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.66666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mbin&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mbin&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;/2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approximation reduces the complexity of computing the probability, from &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&#34;script&#34;&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;\mathcal{O}(k)&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathcal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.02778em;&#34;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&#34;script&#34;&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;\mathcal{O}(1)&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathcal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.02778em;&#34;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Or, phrased in non-computer-science terms: instead of doing around &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;k&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; math operations, we only have to do a small fixed number of them! What&#39;s more, the approximation becomes more and more accurate as we increase &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;N&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;N&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.10903em;&#34;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;approximations-all-the-way-down&#34;&gt;Approximations all the way down&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s possible to simplify this equation even further, using the exact same trick as before! Note that the final line of equation (2) is in the form &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;−&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mo&gt;−&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;y&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;1-e^{-y}&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34;

We see that the exponential approximation gradually gets better as &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;k&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gets smaller. But also, once &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;300&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;k&amp;gt;300&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.73354em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or thereabouts, the relative error drops like a stone. The simpler approximations are kinda reasonable for &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;100&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;k&amp;lt;100&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.73354em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but after that point they go bonkers.&lt;/p&gt;

The exponential approximation is about &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0.0044899&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;0.0044899&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;0.0044899&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and if you squint a little, you could mistake them for the same answer. The simplified approximation is about &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0.0045&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;0.0045&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;0.0045&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which is, you know, still quite good. And the simplest approximation is &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0.005&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;0.005&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;0.005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which is less quite good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to dig into the error behaviour of the approximations, but I think I&#39;ll get a sandwich instead. Something something exercise for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen how to calculate the probability of a hash collision, as well as 3 different ways to approximate this probability. The exponential approximation appears to be robust. The other two are convenient for back of the envelope calculations, but may lose their nerve as you add more books to your collection. Finally, if you want to play around with the birthday problem parameters, I&#39;ve posted a &lt;a href=&#34;/apps/collision.html&#34;&gt;hash collision calculator&lt;/a&gt; on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem obvious (in the case of #2, just set x=0 and they&#39;re the same!), but I was wondering how you would go about it with slightly more rigour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One approach is based on ratios. Use &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;f&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;f(x)&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34;

style=&#34;margin-right:0.10764em;&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to denote the function being approximated, and &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;g&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;g(x)&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s another motivation for avoiding hash collisions. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re designing a customer database for a particularly privacy-conscious fish monger. Rather than storing a customer&#39;s name in the database, which would be a horrific breach of privacy, you can instead apply a hash function to their name and store the resulting hash value. A hash collision occurs when two customers are assigned the same hash value by the hash function, which could result in the customers&#39; fish orders getting mixed up. How embarrassing! What this means is that you need the range of the hash function (the number of buckets, &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;N&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;N&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.10903em;&#34;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), to be large enough that a hash collision is ASTRONOMICALLY UNLIKELY.&amp;#160;&lt;a class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:unique&#34; title=&#34;Jump back to footnote 2 in the text&#34;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>The bit-twiddling magic of two&#39;s complement, explained</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve ever taken a computer science class, then you&#39;ve probably heard of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement&#34;&gt;two&#39;s complement&lt;/a&gt;. What you might have been told is that it&#39;s a system for representing positive and negative numbers in computers, and that to convert a number to two&#39;s complement form, you invert all the bits and add 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#34;Okay,&#34; you may have thought to yourself on hearing this information, unconvinced, &#34;but doesn&#39;t flipping the bits and adding 1 seem kinda arbitrary? And what&#39;s the POINT of two&#39;s complement?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the questions I will attempt to briefly answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an example to reacquaint ourselves with two&#39;s complement. Let&#39;s say you have a decimal number, &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mn&gt;5&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;5_d&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.79444em;vertical-align:-0.15em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;msupsub&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-t vlist-t2&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.33610799999999996em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pstrut&#34; style=&#34;height:2.7em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal mtight&#34;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-s&#34;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.15em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The little &#39;d&#39; stands for decimal. Assuming you have 4 bits, &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mn&gt;5&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;5_d&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.79444em;vertical-align:-0.15em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;msupsub&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-t vlist-t2&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.33610799999999996em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pstrut&#34; style=&#34;height:2.7em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal mtight&#34;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-s&#34;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.15em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;010&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;0101_b&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.79444em;vertical-align:-0.15em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;msupsub&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-t vlist-t2&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.33610799999999996em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pstrut&#34; style=&#34;height:2.7em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal mtight&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-s&#34;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.15em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in binary (where the little &#39;b&#39; stands for binary). To convert this number to two&#39;s complement, you change the 0s to 1s and the 1s to 0s, giving &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;101&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;1010_b&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.79444em;vertical-align:-0.15em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;101&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;msupsub&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-t vlist-t2&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.33610799999999996em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pstrut&#34; style=&#34;height:2.7em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal mtight&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-s&#34;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.15em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and then you add 1, giving &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;101&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;1011_b&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.79444em;vertical-align:-0.15em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;101&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;msupsub&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-t vlist-t2&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.33610799999999996em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pstrut&#34; style=&#34;height:2.7em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal mtight&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-s&#34;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.15em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The POINT of two&#39;s complement, or at least one of the points, is that it allows you to take the same circuitry with which you add, multiply and subtract positive numbers, and use it to add, multiply and subtract negative numbers. This means you don&#39;t need complicated circuitry just for negative numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s explore why negative numbers might require complicated circuitry. Remember how they taught you to add numbers digit-by-digit in school? Computers add numbers in pretty much the same way. They go through the digits from least significant (rightmost) to most significant (leftmost) and add them up individually. If the sum of two digits is too big to store in a single digit, then you have to &lt;em&gt;carry&lt;/em&gt; a 1 over to the next digit, as shown in the example below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/twos/addition.png&#34;
     alt=&#34;Bit-by-bit addition of two binary numbers, 1011 and 0010. The rightmost digits are added first, giving 1+1=0. Then the next two digits are added to give 1+1=0, plus a carry. Then we have 0+0+1=1 (including the carry). And finally, 1+0=1. The result is 1101.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;An example of bit-by-bit addition. The third bits, 1 &amp; 1, add up to 2, which can&#39;t be represented in binary. The sum rolls around to 0 and a 1 (in red) is carried over and added along with the next bits.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This algorithm is easy to model with logic gates because the addition of two digits depends only on the addition of the previous two digits (and whether there was a carry). It doesn&#39;t have to look 10 digits ahead, or 10 digits behind. Just 1 behind. For this reason, the gates can be chained together sequentially, making the circuit straightforward and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subtraction algorithm you learned, on the other hand, is a &lt;em&gt;pain in the ass&lt;/em&gt;. If you&#39;ll recall, it proceeds from right to left, like addition does. But if the negative digit is larger than the positive digit, you have to look arbitrarily far ahead in order to &#34;borrow&#34; from a more significant positive digit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/twos/subtraction.png&#34;
     alt=&#34;Bit-by-bit subtraction of two binary numbers, 1000 and 0011. We have to &#39;borrow&#39; from the first digit of 1000, because in the subtraction of the last digits (0 &amp; 1), 1 is greater than 0.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;An example of bit-by-bit subtraction. We have to borrow from the most significant bit because the least significant bit, a zero, can&#39;t handle the overwhelming firepower of negative one.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the logic gates that perform subtraction for the rightmost bit have to be connected to the leftmost bit somehow -- and all the other bits, too! The resulting circuit will be a tangled mess, like a big ball of hair. Also, if you have an explicit flag that says whether a number is positive or negative, then you need logic to handle updates to this flag, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if... WHAT IF, my friend, you could use the straightforward addition algorithm, but for negative numbers? And what if I told you, my dear friend, that two&#39;s complement allows you to do this! (Please be my friend). It allows you to treat negative numbers as if they were regular, boring old positive numbers, and avoid the ball of hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How exactly does two&#39;s complement work? Forget about the bit-twiddling for now. Let&#39;s say you have 8 bits, which can take on &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mn&gt;8&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;256&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;2^8=256&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.8141079999999999em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;msupsub&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-t&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.8141079999999999em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pstrut&#34; style=&#34;height:2.7em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mtight&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; possible values (indexed from 0 to 255). In the two&#39;s complement system, the first half of the numbers in this range, 0 to 127, are their usual positive selves. +0 is mapped to +0, and +127 is mapped to +127.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

     alt=&#34;The two&#39;s complement number line for 8-bit values. The mapping of raw binary values, to their values in two&#39;s complement, is represented by 256 boxes in a row, indexed by the numbers 0 to 255. The first 128 boxes contain the numbers 0 to 127. The remaining boxes contain the numbers -128 to -1, in descending order.&#34;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the tricky part: the next half of the numbers, 128 to 255, are mapped from -128 to -1. This is like saying that the negative counterpart of a number &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;∈&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;[&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo separator=&#34;true&#34;&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;127&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;]&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;k \in [0,127]&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.73354em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;∈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mpunct&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;127&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, i.e. its two&#39;s complement, is &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mn&gt;8&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;mo&gt;−&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;t(k)=2^8-k&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.897438em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;msupsub&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-t&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.8141079999999999em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pstrut&#34; style=&#34;height:2.7em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mtight&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mbin&#34;&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this fact goes some of the way to convincing you that two&#39;s complement is a sensible system. That we can take the two&#39;s complement of a number, and it will behave like the negative of that number when we add it to something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding the two&#39;s complement form of a number is like subtracting it, under modulo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some more facts about two&#39;s complement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you take the two&#39;s complement of a number that&#39;s already in two&#39;s complement form, you get the number back: &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;mo&gt;−&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;mo&gt;−&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;t(t(k)) = 2^b-(2^b-k) = k&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.932438em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;msupsub&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-t&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.849108em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pstrut&#34; style=&#34;height:2.7em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal mtight&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mbin&#34;&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1.099108em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;msupsub&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-t&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.849108em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pstrut&#34; style=&#34;height:2.7em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal mtight&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mbin&#34;&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It&#39;s the same as negating a negative number, which makes it positive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To subtract a number from another number in two&#39;s complement, you convert the number you want to subtract into two&#39;s complement form, then add it to the other number. (See: the equation above where we add &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;k&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;l&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;t(l)&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.01968em;&#34;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). No hairy circuits involved!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. There are two details about two&#39;s complement left to discuss. The first detail is the big wart on its backside. The second detail is the bit-twiddling that was used to introduce you to two&#39;s complement all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wart on two&#39;s complement&#39;s bottom is that, as you may have noticed, there&#39;s no +128 to match -128 in our 8-bit number line! The two&#39;s complement operation applied to 128 gives &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;128&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;256&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;−&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;128&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;128&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;t(128)=256-128=128&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.72777em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mbin&#34;&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. That is, the two&#39;s complement of 128 is itself. There&#39;s no space left to represent both +128 and -128, so we have to map the value 128 to only one of them. I&#39;m not sure why, but the convention is to pick -128. Some things still work as expected: &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;128&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;128&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;129&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;127&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;1+t(128)=128+1=129=t(127)&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.72777em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mbin&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.72777em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mbin&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;127&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, i.e. adding 1 to -128 still gives -127. But when we try to negate -128, we get: &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;128&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;mo&gt;−&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;mo&gt;−&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;128&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;128&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;128&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;t(t(128))=2^b-(2^b-128)=128=t(128)&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34;

&lt;p&gt;This can be the source of nightmarish bugs. And, since all modern computers use two&#39;s complement (if I recall correctly, this fact is going to be enshrined in the C standard), you can&#39;t avoid it. If you compile and run the following C code on your computer, it will most probably print -128.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cpf&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;-128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;%d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, here it is. The moment that nobody has been waiting for. Where does the bit-twiddling come from? We have described the two&#39;s complement form as &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;mo&gt;−&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;t(k)=2^b-k&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mrel&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.932438em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;msupsub&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-t&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.849108em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pstrut&#34; style=&#34;height:2.7em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal mtight&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mbin&#34;&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, so why is it introduced using bit flips and rogue +1&#39;s? I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s introduced in such a confusing way, but the bit-twiddling magic is just a trick to compute &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;t(k)&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; without performing subtraction or needing to store &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;2^b&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.849108em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;msupsub&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-t&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist-r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;vlist&#34; style=&#34;height:0.849108em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pstrut&#34; style=&#34;height:2.7em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal mtight&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; anywhere (which would require &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;b+1&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.77777em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mbin&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; bits). This is easiest to demonstrate with an example.
