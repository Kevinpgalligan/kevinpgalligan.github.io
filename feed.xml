        <title>Camino diary, days 20-24</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-20-friday-october-27th-2023-mondonedo-1937km-49208km-total&#34;&gt;Day 20, Friday, October 27th 2023, Mondoñedo (19.37km, 492.08km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I left, Nicole pointedly reminded me where to find the donation box. More like &#34;coercion&#34; box, amirite? I&#39;d already left some money, anyway. Reading reviews for Granja de Calor, there seemed to be a lot of people complaining about how shabby the place was. I guess that&#39;s why they made it a donativo albergue. They couldn&#39;t be held to the same standards as other albergues if people got to stay there for free and donate whatever they wanted... right??? Regardless, I&#39;d enjoyed hearing their story and the food had been tasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The rabbits at Granja de Calor. I&#39;d seen the grisly fate that awaited them...&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day: boredom, monotony, and the ascension and descension of hilly forested trails. Every day the landscape reminded me more of Ireland. Patchwork farms and vivid green vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sheltered under a bus stop during a sudden downpour and watched chess videos on my phone. Popped in to a café for a snack and a drink, where there were 4 old guys speaking &lt;em&gt;gallego&lt;/em&gt; (the local language of Galicia). It sounded like strongly accented Spanish, with a sprinkling of Portuguese, but I couldn&#39;t understand a word. I stopped for lunch in Lourenzá, then continued on until Mondoñedo. My accommodation, Hotel Padornelo, was basic but functional, and cost €30 for the night. A kind lady checked me in and complimented my Spanish, even though I&#39;d only said a few stock phrases to navigate our interaction. For food, I went to a lively bar that was a short walk away in the town. There I had patatas bravas, croquettes and red wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-21-saturday-october-28th-gontan-1543km-50751km-total&#34;&gt;Day 21, Saturday, October 28th, Gontán (15.43km, 507.51km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ascent of 700m, and the wind was very strong and annoying. Wind turbines everywhere. I left late in the morning, feeling bored and low in motivation. I hoped it was a phase and that my enthusiasm would soon return. Perhaps it was a consequence of the relative isolation I&#39;d experienced the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Walking among the wind turbines.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a typical day, when walking alone, I whistled and sang to entertain myself. I also learned a Spanish rhyme to practice the double R sound: &#34;Erre con erre cigarro, erre con erre barril, rápido ruedan los carros cargados de azúcar del ferrocarril&#34;. (Or: &#34;R with R cigarre, R with R barrel, the cars of the train roll quickly loaded with sugar&#34;). It was a conscious decision not to bring earphones, since listening to music or podcasts might distract from my surroundings. Even without earphones, however, I often daydreamed my way through much of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encountered Nico, the giant bearded Frenchman who talked and laughed to himself in French. We always exchanged a friendly greeting, despite the language barrier. He had made efforts to speak to me in French, but I was only ever able to pick up a word or two. French would probably be the most useful language to know on the Camino after Spanish and English, since there were a lot of monolingual French speakers walking it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/video&gt; 
&lt;figcaption&gt;The annoying wind.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a short segment, ending in Gontán, and yet, due to my lack of motivation, I was relieved to be finished for the day. I was lucky to miss a downpour that started shortly after I arrived. Among the people in my albergue were: Nico; Sonia and Mira (the Ukrainians); Contain (my best attempt to transcribe his French name); and a Spanish man who humblebragged about how far he was walking each day. I ate a tortilla sandwich at a typical Spanish bar, and spent the rest of the evening talking to the other pilgrims. I finally learned a bit more about the life situation of Sonia and Mira. Sonia had left Ukraine at the beginning of the war and was now living in Berlin. Mira had also left and was somehow involved in acting or the arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-22-sunday-october-29th-vilalba-216km-52911km-total&#34;&gt;Day 22, Sunday, October 29th, Vilalba (21.6km, 529.11km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flat terrain, a little muddy but nothing unpassable. My ankle wasn&#39;t hurting so much anymore, but it still felt fragile and I was hesitant to walk on it too fast or for too long. I met some new people: Robert (from Canada), Mary (from Las Vegas), and Chris and Monica (a Swiss couple I remembered seeing earlier in the trip, perhaps at Padre Ernesto&#39;s albergue). Robert and I went for tea on arriving at Vilalba. He was a 70-year-old carpenter from Vancouver. Since my sister was living there and I&#39;d gone to visit her a few times, I knew a bit about the place. He said he&#39;d grown up in Vancouver before it had blown up in size, population, and expensiveness. His brother had been a victim of the opioid crisis in North America, like many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Walking in the woods.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also spoke of the Palestine-Israel conflict. Robert believed that it was a religious conflict, fuelled by extremists on both sides. Ignorant as I was about the history of Palestine, I didn&#39;t buy that narrative. People often (mistakenly) said the same thing about the conflict in Northern Ireland: Catholics and Protestants, unable to reconcile over minute doctrinal differences in their religions! This is a convenient gloss over the colonial roots of these conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After tea, I went to my albergue, As Pedreiras, which turned out to be lovely. It was warm, there was a guitar, and there were cool maps hanging from the wall. Everyone was given their own towel, sheets and pillow. When the host saw me noodling with the guitar, he pulled out his own guitar from behind the reception and I was conscripted into a mini concert. We played a few songs that he had sheet music for: &lt;em&gt;La flaca&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Let It Be&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mariposa traicionera&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;El sonido de silencio&lt;/em&gt; (The Sound of Silence). By the end, my hands were trembling from the hunger, since all the supermarkets were closed on Sundays and I hadn&#39;t been able to buy food anywhere. I rushed to find a restaurant, and ended up at A Taberna, where I gorged myself on spaghetti with tomato sauce, padrón peppers, bread, &lt;em&gt;tarta de abuela&lt;/em&gt; (grandma&#39;s tart), and a caña.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The evening&#39;s food.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the albergue were all the aforementioned pilgrims, as well as Ivano (the &#34;citizen of the world&#34;), the boastful Spaniard (from Granada, he wasn&#39;t so bad), a Dutch guy called Jeron (probably a transcription error), and a German gentleman who claimed to be walking 40km per day. German Man was barefoot, so Spanish Man asked me to tell him that he should put on his socks to avoid the risk of fungal infection. I acted as a translator between the two men for a few minutes, which was always a fun experience. I then continued talking to the German guy in a mix of English and half-remembered German from school. It was a novelty to encounter a German who didn&#39;t speak English at a high level. That said, his English was still a lot better than my German.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a bit and watched some shite on my phone before bed. My progress with &lt;em&gt;Los detectives salvajes&lt;/em&gt; was slow. Such a long book, with so very little happening in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-23-monday-october-30th-a-lagoa-40km-56911km-total&#34;&gt;Day 23, Monday, October 30th, A Lagoa (40km, 569.11km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left Vilalba fairly late, after having breakfast in a cafetería. It was a cold morning, and I could see my own breath, but my enthusiasm had been renewed, probably from all the socialising I&#39;d done the day before. I also hadn&#39;t been getting enough sleep, so it must&#39;ve helped to get a reasonably good rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&#34;DEPORT AMERICANS.&#34;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an intense day, emotionally speaking. I was walking past some houses in the countryside when I heard a pained cry for help from someone&#39;s garden. I looked around and caught a glimpse of bright red. It was an old lady lying on the ground with blood on her face. I ran over to her. She&#39;d fallen down the stairs at the side of her house. She said her head was sore, and it hurt her to move, so I didn&#39;t want to risk lifting or moving her. There was blood dripping from a gash above her mouth. I couldn&#39;t tell if she had broken a bone. She also seemed confused, as when I asked where her family was, her answer varied between her house, Bilbao, and Vilalba. Either that, or my Spanish comprehension was failing me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&#39;t sure what to do. I tried to support her back so she wasn&#39;t just lying there on the ground. She didn&#39;t want me to call the emergency services, for some reason - maybe in denial of how serious the situation was? Or worried that they&#39;d take her away from her home? She kept trying to give me money, even though I&#39;d been pretty useless up to that point. I asked her if she had any neighbours, then went to find them in the direction she pointed. By this point, I was full of adrenaline and my mind was completely focused on resolving the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next door, I found an elderly couple who seemed to be farmers. Their dog let it be known that my presence wasn&#39;t appreciated. The neighbours themselves, when I told them what had happened, said that they didn&#39;t want to get involved. Something about how the woman had burned all her bridges. I at least managed to extract from them the street address and the woman&#39;s name. The wife let out a stream of curse words - not directed at me, she just seemed really stressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disgusted by their unwillingness to help, I returned to the injured woman, and after another inconclusive attempt to convince her that we should call the emergency services, I just went ahead and did it. I knew the European-wide emergency number was 112. This was my first time calling it. I was passed from person to person as they narrowed down where I was and what the problem was. It took me a while to explain, in halting Spanish, what had happened and exactly where the house was located. It didn&#39;t help that my phone&#39;s GPS was imprecise in that area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the call, I was joined by a French couple who were passing by on their Camino. They spoke neither English nor Spanish, but they were at least able to offer their emotional support, and even went in search of more neighbours, only to find the same useless pair that I&#39;d encountered earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, three female paramedics arrived in an ambulance and attended to the injured woman, at which point she began to cry. She gave me a key to her house and asked me to make sure the front door was locked. After that, with the situation under control, I had a moment to breathe, and released some tears of my own. The tears came from shock, relief, and the sadness of the situation. Here was a woman living by herself, senile, with seemingly no family taking care of her, and alienated from her neighbours. I could only hope she&#39;d be well taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the paramedics assured me that everything was okay, I left. I was so frazzled that I neglected to say goodbye to the woman. Later, I also regretted that I hadn&#39;t told off the neighbours for their ugly behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked quickly, still feeling emotional. I passed the French couple, who had left a minute or so before me. They shared a sympathetic look and checked that I was okay. And then, for the second time on the Camino, I passed a dead badger on the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I walked, I reflected on what had happened and on some associated coincidences. I was reminded of the painting in Padre Ernesto&#39;s albergue, which depicted pilgrims helping a person in need - the injured woman and I had been in the same pose, with her lying on the ground and me crouched at her side supporting her back! I&#39;d also wondered to myself, while walking through the remote countryside, what would happen if I encountered an injured person. And a week or so previously, I&#39;d seen a dog wandering about with a leash trailing behind it, and I&#39;d had the morbid thought that maybe its owner had collapsed somewhere while bringing it for a walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing. This had been my first time interacting with emergency services. I&#39;d never fully appreciated how amazing it was that a single phonecall could summon an ambulance, or a police car, or a firetruck to help a citizen in need. Society is actually kinda good, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231030_143329.jpg&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Looked like two seasons side by side.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived at Baamonde, where I found Ivano and Jean (a French man who had been at the albergue in Vilalba). I told them about my dramatic experience, bought some provisions at a shop there, and then set out with them towards an albergue called A Lagoa, which was about 13km ahead. I&#39;d wanted to do a shorter segment (31km vs 40km), but I didn&#39;t have a choice because the closer albergue was closed. In any case, A&amp;amp;W had stayed at A Lagoa two days previously and recommended it, and Ivano and Jean were good company. We walked through deciduous forests, and passed by a church from the 16th century. I got a blister on one of my toes, but it barely hurt and it was a while before I even noticed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231030_151526_1.jpg&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A really old church.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the day, we walked by the house of an old sculpture artist. Ivano seemed to have heard of him. The man himself was at home and he invited us inside to look around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Books, guitar and a message engraved in stone. Among the books were &lt;i&gt;Dune&lt;/i&gt; by Frank Herbert and &lt;i&gt;El amante japonés&lt;/i&gt; by Isabel Allende. An extract from the engraving: &#34;[...]between the noise and the hurry remember that there can be peace in silence. Live on good terms with all people, as much as is possible without surrendering oneself. Say your truth calmly and clearly, and listen to others, including the boring and the ignorant, as they too have their story to tell. [...]&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at A Lagoa and met the kind host that A&amp;amp;W had told me about. Many pilgrims I&#39;d recently encountered were already there: Nico, Robert (the Canadian), Mary (the &lt;em&gt;estadounidense&lt;/em&gt;), and Monica and Chris (the Swiss couple). We ate well: the host&#39;s mother made us soup, pasta, and &lt;em&gt;tarta de Santiago&lt;/em&gt; (a type of almond cake). I had a few glasses of a local wine, and they gave us some slices of leftover birthday cake. I told my new pals the story of the fallen woman. Monica in particular showed me a lot of empathy, and seemed to understand how distressing the incident had been. From that moment on, I felt very fond of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-24-tuesday-october-31st-sobrado-dos-monxes-2729km-5964km-total&#34;&gt;Day 24, Tuesday, October 31st, Sobrado dos Monxes (27.29km, 596.4km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the albergue around 8am. My destination for the day was Sobrado dos Monxes, and the monastery there that offered accommodation for pilgrims. I walked alone at first, but encountered other pilgrims along the way. I stopped to chat with Mary, Monica, Chris and Robert in a café. This segment wasn&#39;t challenging, but I did have to cross a giant muddy puddle, in the process of which my shoes and socks got soaked. I just hoped there wasn&#39;t any &lt;em&gt;caca de vaca&lt;/em&gt; (cow shit) in there. Afterwards, I took off my socks to squeeze the brown water out of them. Yuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial farms. Grey buildings with no windows. If light couldn&#39;t enter, then the day-and-night cycle of the animals could be controlled, and in that way, chickens, for example, could be manipulated to produce more eggs. Grain silos for feeding them. I didn&#39;t want to imagine what was inside the grey buildings. Thousands and thousands of suffering animals. Crowded together, stressed, never seeing the sun, sleeping on their own faeces. Selectively bred for farming, at the expense of their physical health. Spain was famous for its pig meat, but I hadn&#39;t seen a single pig along the way, which probably didn&#39;t bode well for the pigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The lake outside Sobrado.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sobrado. It was situated beside an artificial lake that was 100s of years old. Very pretty, but I didn&#39;t spend too long admiring it because a storm was about to break out. I arrived at the monastery and was greeted by an English monk called Laurence. He checked me in, along with other pilgrims who&#39;d arrived around the same time - Monica, Chris and Robert. Laurence was a funny character. His words dripped with irony, and he didn&#39;t seem to suffer fools. He&#39;d adopted an affectionate orphan cat called Maximilian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More about Monica and Chris. Monica was a kindergarten teacher, Chris was an electrician. Now they were working half-time, at their leisure. They&#39;d been vegetarians for 30 years, and for 20 of those years they&#39;d owned an organic food shop. Their son walked the Northern Way when he was only 18, though he did suffer some mishaps along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Maximilian the cat.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening, I went for some cañas with Robert. We saw a man playing a slot machine in the corner. It was making him very angry. I struck up conversation with some Spanish people who were playing cards at another table. They were playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinch%C3%B3n_(card_game)&#34;&gt;chinchón&lt;/a&gt;, a matching game that seemed to be similar to gin rummy and mahjong. Two of them turned out to be from Bilbao and were visiting their friends in Sobrado. Later, Robert and I got dinner at a bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;From inside the monastery.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to explain to Ivano that Irish people aren&#39;t British. I couldn&#39;t complain, though, since I&#39;d accidentally called Robert an &lt;em&gt;estadounidense&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night, I went to bed around 11pm and, as usual, filled out my diary with the day&#39;s events, surrounded by the sounds of snoring and pattering rain. I was conscious that my words were unable to transmit even one-hundredth of the experience of being there. I couldn&#39;t truly capture the sights, the sounds, the smells, or the feelings, and there were countless anecdotes I&#39;d forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More about the monk, Laurence. During the check-in, he complained to us good-humouredly. Apparently, on receiving his assignment to Sobrado, his superiors had told him &#34;you&#39;re English, so we&#39;re sending you there&#34; (I guess because he could speak English to the pilgrims). He&#39;d been at the Sobrado monastery for 14 years, since 2009. Before that, he&#39;d spent many years in Italy. He spoke French and was able to communicate with Nico. He left us old newspapers to dry out our shoes, among which I found a recent edition of El País that I decided to bring with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;A passive-aggressive note left in the bathroom by Laurence the monk. &#34;OUT OF ORDER because of the disgusting behaviour of male pilgrims&#34;. I think he mentioned that pilgrims had blocked the toilets by using endless reams of toilet paper to create a cushion on the seat.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

        <title>Camino diary, days 15-19</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-15-sunday-october-22nd-2023-cadavedo-305km-3879km-total&#34;&gt;Day 15, Sunday, October 22nd 2023, Cadavedo (30.5km, 387.9km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was still mostly dark out when we left the albergue. Sergio and I happened to leave at the same time, but we separated when I took an Aurora-endorsed shortcut back to the main trail. I stopped at a café, where other pilgrims I knew gradually filtered in: A&amp;amp;W, Mira the Ukrainian, Kobi the Dutch 17-year-old, his Camino Dad Tony, and Sergio. In passing, I thought I heard a local Spaniard mutter &#34;puto blanco&#34; under his breath, which I think would translate to &#34;white bastard&#34;? If he was indeed referring to me, then the meaning was pretty clear. A refreshing change from hearing &#34;Buen Camino&#34; every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;These bridges seemed to come from a dystopian future, or Half-Life 2.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aurora left her walking stick (a literal stick) behind in the café. I caught up with her to return it and ended up walking with her and Wesley once again. It was a challenging segment, with hard surfaces and lots of hills, but the scenery was worth it. We walked through forests and crossed over streams. Out of boredom, I picked up some fallen branches and hurled them like javelins. We all laughed when a bird made an indignant squawk just as one of these branches landed among the trees. The coastal landscapes of this segment were among the most beautiful I&#39;d seen on the Camino up to that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived, tired, at Cadavedo. I got a room in an albergue (Casa de Peregrinos Covi y Peter) with Sergio, Tony and Kobi. We went to a place called Casino Bar for food, where I had patatas bravas and a veggie burger. Ivano from Sicily joined us. I discovered that he&#39;d done the Camino more than 20 times, and he&#39;d been living outside Italy for so long that he barely considered himself Italian - more a &#34;citizen of the world&#34;. Sergio bought shots for everyone. I overheard him and Tony discussing their respective divorces, and both men seemed to feel a lot of pain over it. I was curious to hear more about their experiences, since I hadn&#39;t talked to anyone about divorce before, but didn&#39;t want to intrude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, the approach of Santiago came up in conversation. I felt sad at the prospect of reaching the end, which I guess was a sign of how much I was enjoying the experience, despite all the fretting I was doing over my injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-16-monday-october-23rd-villapedre-2822km-41612km-total&#34;&gt;Day 16, Monday, October 23rd, Villapedre (28.22km, 416.12km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was the last one to leave the albergue. I noticed a few insect bites on my feet and hoped they weren&#39;t from bedbugs (&lt;em&gt;chinches&lt;/em&gt;). Something about bedbugs has always creeped me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped at a café to rest, after about an hour of walking, and ordered a tortilla and a cup of black tea. I&#39;d grown to look forward to these tea breaks, and the sanctuary of a warm cuppa. Sergio, Kobi, and A&amp;amp;W caught up with me before long. I continued on with A&amp;amp;W to Luarca, the stop suggested by the Buen Camino app. I wanted to keep walking with A&amp;amp;W, so I followed them to Villapedre, about 12km further. It wasn&#39;t as tough as the day before, but my left foot did start to hurt by the end. Along the way we talked about spirituality, recreational drugs, and life plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Closer to the port in Luarca.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ankle didn&#39;t seem to hurt so much when I was standing or walking, but it was still swollen and tended to be sore in the mornings. I hoped it wasn&#39;t a serious injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231023_133536.jpg&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Leaving Luarca.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Villapedre I checked into the hotel El Pinar. I spent the evening in bed, keeping my ankle elevated, watching trashy TV, and eating pizza. One of the shows was &lt;em&gt;El Cazador&lt;/em&gt; (The Hunter), the Spanish equivalent of The Chase. I was humbled by a Spanish comedy show where I couldn&#39;t understand a single word the comedians were saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt conscious of the privilege I had, being able to stay in hotels whenever I wanted more comfort and privacy. Of course, this was all inconsequential compared to the plight of people in Gaza, who were being murdered every day while I was preoccupied by trivialities like insect bites and a swollen ankle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-17-tuesday-october-24th-la-caridad-1799km-43411km-total&#34;&gt;Day 17, Tuesday, October 24th, La Caridad (17.99km, 434.11km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited until it stopped raining before leaving the hotel, but the wind was still so strong that it nearly knocked me over a few times. I was saddened to see some dairy cows in a barn, separated from their calves by metal fencing and a distance of 100-200m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231024_113648.jpg&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;...and their calves.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While passing through Piñera, the town where A&amp;amp;W and some other pilgrims I knew had stayed the night before, I was greeted by a local man called Jose-Luis. He said he liked to talk with passing pilgrims and take their picture, which I agreed to let him do, though it was a struggle to hold still with all the wind. I felt mildly uncomfortable when he commented on the blueness of my eyes while staring deeply into them. He spoke about how it&#39;s a privilege to take someone&#39;s picture, and how there&#39;s an element of creation in each of us. I tried to be receptive to what he was saying, but there was still a small part of me that never moved on from the contemptuousness of the &lt;em&gt;God Delusion&lt;/em&gt; phase I went through as a teenager. I knew I needed to work on being more accepting of other people&#39;s beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG-20231024-WA0006.jpg&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Getting blasted by wind while Jose-Luis took my picture. He later sent me the pictures over WhatsApp.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little while later, I stopped in at a shop and chatted to the shopkeeper for a while. She happened to know Jose-Luis, and seemed amused when I recounted the things he&#39;d said to me. We agreed that &lt;em&gt;tiene sus cositas&lt;/em&gt; - &#34;he has his little things&#34;, which I interpreted to mean &#34;has his peculiarities&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231024_122609.jpg&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Pilgrim graffiti. The Spanish part says &#34;Traveler, there is no path/Camino. The path is made by walking&#34;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed that my mind tended to wander while I was walking, and I wasn&#39;t attentive to my surroundings. It wasn&#39;t a problem, as such, but it&#39;d be a shame if I spent the whole Camino daydreaming. That said, I did stop to appreciate the scenery as I left Navia, a town about halfway between Villaprende and La Caridad, which was my final stop for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231024_135845.jpg&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking back at Navia.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived at La Caridad without any other occurrences of note, and went to the albergue A Caridá. Basic but clean. I spoke with 3 different Spanish people there. Lots of Spanish practice that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sketch of the typical bar or cafetería along the Camino. A sleepy place. Tiled floor, wooden counter, overly bright lights. Tortilla de patatas and meat sandwiches on display. One type of beer on tap, if any. Usually Estrella. Otherwise, it&#39;s 330ml bottles. You just ask for &lt;em&gt;cerveza&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;vino&lt;/em&gt; - no multiple choice here, thank you very much! Old men sitting at the counter, just like you&#39;d see in an Irish pub. They speak in the local language, or they speak Spanish so quickly and with such a strong accent that it may as well be a different language. Sometimes they still wear their work clothes, trousers stained with mud from the fields of the surrounding countryside. Trash TV in the background, and a gambling machine in the corner. Relatively cheap - that day I paid €3.30 for black tea and pain au chocolate. In Ireland it&#39;d probably cost at least €6. In the bathroom, the hand dryer is always broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More about prices. Bottles of wine cost €2-10 in the supermarkets. In Ireland, you&#39;d pay €10 for the cheapest bottles of wine at Tesco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Cheap Spanish wines in a random supermarket. All less than €10.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-18-wednesday-october-25th-ribadeo-216km-45571km-total&#34;&gt;Day 18, Wednesday, October 25th, Ribadeo (21.6km, 455.71km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t sleep very well. Got woken up by a mosquito buzzing in my ear. The bathroom had the highest urinal I&#39;d ever seen. Various people entered the room while I was trying to sleep. Torches swung from their necks and flashed in all directions. There was also much rustling of plastic bags, and deafening alarms in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left for Ribadeo at 7/8am, before sunrise. It was another day of strong wind. I tried to be more &#34;present&#34;, after my reflections of the day before, but it wasn&#39;t long before my mind started to wander again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231025_084812.jpg&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A pilgrim scarecrow sent me on my way.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking, shouting into the wind, worrying about my sore ankle. Arrived at the &lt;em&gt;Puente de Santos&lt;/em&gt; (Bridge of Saints), a 600m-long bridge that led into Ribadeo. This was the crossover point into the autonomous community of Galicia. The bridge was high above the river below, and so windy that it literally took my breath away. I made it across safely, and was then amused at a cyclist passing me in the opposite direction. He didn&#39;t get off his bike for the crossing, and as he moved into the distance I could&#39;ve sworn I saw him get knocked over by the wind. My phone was dead by this point, so I had to ask random passersby for directions to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hostel was clean, and spacious due to a lack of pilgrims. I had a bunkbed to myself in the corner of the room, which gave me a good deal of privacy. I ate at Kalpa Amodiño, an Indian-Iberian fusion restaurant. Stuffed roti, home-brewed kombucha, and a coconut dessert - all delicious! The server was friendly, and also present was the owner&#39;s 10-year-old daughter, who was very cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night I wasted a couple of hours browsing Reddit before going to sleep around 2am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-19-thursday-october-26th-granja-de-calor-17km-47271km-total&#34;&gt;Day 19, Thursday, October 26th, Granja de Calor (17km, 472.71km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day of heavy rain. I had breakfast with a Czech person, a French woman (who&#39;d cycled all the way from Norway over 5 months), an Andalucian, and a French couple who were doing the Camino by car. All were friendly. I ordered another tea, avoiding the rain for as long as possible. When I did leave, the rain and greyness of the day made it a melancholic walk through the streets. I saw the restaurant from the day before and felt sad that I mightn&#39;t ever eat there again, nor pass through Ribadeo itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The melancholy of Ribadeo.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before even making it out of the city, the rain got so bad that I sought refuge under a café terrace. I ordered 6 churros with chocolate, and yet another black tea, and spent a couple of hours reading my book and enjoying the moody atmosphere and rain sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231026_094705.jpg&#34;

&lt;/video&gt; 
&lt;figcaption&gt;The rain.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While sitting there, I was approached by an older American woman from the albergue. We chatted for a while. Her name was Griffin, and she was from New Mexico. Her nickname was &#34;Doc&#34;, probably because she had done a history PhD. Among other things, she told me about her denomination of Christianity, the Episcopal Church, and how it was basically the US equivalent of the Anglican Church in England. It has male and female priests, and they can get married. They even had a gay head bishop, their equivalent of the archibishop of Canterbury. However, she did add that this resulted in the departure of some homophobic congregants, who promptly registered at another, more bigoted church. Griffin was on her way to Santiago to volunteer at a place called Pilgrim House, although her intention to walk the whole way had been curtailed by an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left at around 11am, bidding farewell to Ribadeo and the sea. We&#39;d be walking inland from this point onwards. Didn&#39;t see many people. There were woods and ascents. It started to rain again while I was walking through the forest. I hid among the trees in an improvised shelter that someone else had made from branches. I hung my poncho over the shelter like a tarpaulin, and waited for the rain to ease up. Meanwhile, there were two slugs committing obscene acts at my feet, which made me feel like the camera crew in a nature documentary, camped out in a hidden observation post. There was a croaking sound at my back. I must&#39;ve been half asleep, because I imagined it to be the growling of a mother wolf, protective of her cubs and ready to go for my throat. I didn&#39;t humour my delusions by turning around to check, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231026_140559.jpg&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;These waymarkers started to appear, showing the remaining distance to Santiago. Just 186.535km to go!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I resigned myself to getting wet, because I&#39;d been there for ages and there wasn&#39;t even a small patch of blue in the sky. Fortunately, it stopped raining a short while after I set off again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 6pm, after walking for 17km, I arrived at Granja de Calor (&#34;farm of warmth&#34;), a donativo albergue. Aurora had texted me about this place a few hours before. I wanted to walk further, but my phone was running out of battery, so I decided to stop in to charge it and have a rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 3 German people living there. Freddy and Nicole were the owners, and Andy was their guest. There was also Cami, Andy&#39;s dog. Back in Frankfurt, Freddy had been a masseuse / sauna guy and Nicole had been a kindergarten teacher. They had bought this land about 2 years previously, after passing by it while doing the Northern Way. Their land was nestled among a rural community of about 30 people. Their goal was to live self-sufficiently. Andy had stayed with them during his own Camino, and had returned to help out on their farm for a while. During that same Camino he&#39;d found Cami the dog (who was very affectionate) unattended in a forest and had adopted her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on the farm. They had learned about farming and homesteading from videos on YouTube. They owned sheep, chickens, rabbits and vegetables. Nicole said she would only eat meat from animals they&#39;d slaughtered themselves. Their neighbours, kind and welcoming people, were curious about them, since it was unusual to see new faces in such a small community, never mind foreign faces. There was an annual festival in the area that attracted about 2000 people. It included a music concert that only started at midnight and carried on well into the early hours. Wolves in the area had preyed on sheep, so they had to keep their animals inside after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially sat down just to chat, have a cup of tea, and charge my phone, but I realised that the next stop was over 3 hours away and it&#39;d be completely dark by the time I arrived there. So, I felt I didn&#39;t have a choice but to stay. I experienced a brief moment of panic and regret. Skins of slaughtered rabbits hung in the workshop, the farmhouse was grotty and isolated, and I&#39;d be the only pilgrim staying there. The perfect recipe for Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Camino Edition. However, a quick bit of internet sleuthing turned up some positive reviews, reassuring me that they weren&#39;t crazed killers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freddy showed me around the property. They had a barn for their animals, and were in the process of building a sauna that passing pilgrims could pay to use. I then helped to chop vegetables from their garden for dinner. There were 2 woodlice hiding in the onion, and a mouse was hiding in the kitchen somewhere, but the food turned out well. Salted padrón peppers, scrambled eggs mixed with peppers, and bread. It was the usual game of Russian (pepper) roulette, as most of the peppers weren&#39;t spicy at all but a few were VERY spicy. I appreciated this meal for its simple but strong flavours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Chopping garlic for dinner.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freddy shared a line that captured part of their philosophy for the farm: &lt;em&gt;cada uno en su casa haz lo que quiera&lt;/em&gt;, or &#34;everyone in their home do what they want&#34;. I guess that&#39;s not an unusual idea for people who move to the middle of nowhere to escape city life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night, I didn&#39;t feel comfortable in the bed. The room was dusty and creepy. The main entrance to the house was drafty, and it was very cold. I forgot to ask Freddy and Nicole for a blanket before they went to bed, so I thought I was going to be awake freezing the whole night, but thankfully Freddy came back downstairs for something, a blanket was bestowed upon me when I asked for one, and I managed to get to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Camino diary, days 10-14</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-10-tuesday-october-17th-2023-priesca-286km-2917km-total&#34;&gt;Day 10, Tuesday, October 17th 2023, Priesca (28.6km, 291.7km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left Ribadesella around 9am/10am. This turned out to be a difficult segment, with lots of ups and downs. While descending one of the hills, I went over on my left ankle and hurt it. Another annoying injury, joining the blister on my left foot. I didn&#39;t see many pilgrims, besides an &lt;em&gt;estandounidense&lt;/em&gt; whom I recognised as the volunteer translator from Padre Ernesto&#39;s albergue. She was there with her partner and her dog, Coco. They were walking with another American and didn&#39;t seem interested in talking to me, so I overtook them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While absorbed in a map on my phone, I got a fright from a flash of orange and black stripes in the corner of my eye. It appeared to be a writhing, snake-like creature, but it disappeared before I could get a proper look at it. I don&#39;t think there are snakes like that in Spain, so it was probably a salamander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231029_095226.jpg&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Maybe it was a salamander like this one, which I saw on a later date. (I couldn&#39;t tell if it was giving birth, mortally wounded, or what).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another scary encounter, an angry German Shepherd lunged at me from the back of a passing pickup truck. It was held back by a chain, but for a second I thought I was screwed. Well, it wouldn&#39;t be a day on the Camino if I didn&#39;t get a jumpscare from an aggressive dog. It actually seemed to be normal on Spanish farms for dogs to be tied up with a chain around their neck. I don&#39;t think that&#39;d be allowed in Ireland or the UK? Meanwhile, the cats were free to roam, and I often saw them crouched in fields, probably waiting for mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped for the day at Priesca, about 3km from Sebrayo, my intended destination. The albergue, La Rectoral, turned out to be wonderful, with a friendly host called Susana. Also present at the albergue were: Jana; the two French ladies; 4 Spanish guys I&#39;d seen in passing; Lee, from Taiwan; and a momma cat and her kittens &amp;lt;3 Lee shared his pasta with me - there were no supermarkets or restaurants nearby, as this part of the route was more rural than before. From my own supplies I also ate an apple, a pear, a banana, and an Alpro yoghurt (which I now know is on the BDS boycott list, woops). After dinner I spent a long time hanging out with the kittens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-11-wednesday-october-18th-peon-237km-3154km-total&#34;&gt;Day 11, Wednesday, October 18th, Peón (23.7km, 315.4km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kittens kept me company during breakfast. I decided to break with the Buen Camino schedule, because my ankle was still sore and I didn&#39;t want to walk too far that day. Through discussions with Jana and Lee, I settled on Peón as my destination. It was at this point that I realised the Buen Camino itinerary was different to the one I&#39;d originally planned, and I was actually a couple of days ahead of schedule. If, after reaching Peón, I followed the Buen Camino schedule for the rest of the trip, then my stops would be...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oct 18th: Peón&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oct 19th: Gijón (14km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oct 20th: Avilés (25km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oct 21st: Soto de Luiña (37.8km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oct 22nd: Cadavedo (20.5km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oct 23rd: Luarca (15.6km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oct 24th: La Caridad (30.6km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oct 25th: Ribadeo (21.6km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oct 26th: Lourenzá (27.5km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oct 27th: Gontán (20.7km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oct 28th: Villalba (21.6km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oct 29th: Baamonde (18.7km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oct 30th: Sobrado dos Monxes (40.1km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oct 31st: Arzúa (21.9km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nov 1st: Santiago de Compostela (38.6km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and I would then have 5 days to spare, as my flight wasn&#39;t until November 6th. This was a relief, because I&#39;d thought I was &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt; schedule, if anything, due to taking a day to be a tourist in Bilbao and due to my early stop in Priesca. I decided to roughly follow the Buen Camino plan, but maybe shortening some of the longer stages and lengthening some of the shorter ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The momma cat giving me a baleful look.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a day of monotonous walking through the countryside, the other pilgrims and I had to scale a steep hill. It was challenging, especially since I was trying to keep weight off my left leg, what with the blister and the mild ankle injury. While climbing the hill I encountered a few pilgrims who&#39;d been at the albergue: Lee, Jana, and the 4 Spanish guys. I also encountered... Marty, the &lt;em&gt;estadounidense&lt;/em&gt; (American) I&#39;d shared a room with back in the first convent I stayed at. He&#39;d fallen behind and I hadn&#39;t seen him in a while, but he told me he&#39;d caught up by taking a bus. There was something delightful about running into people I hadn&#39;t expected to see again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&#34;These canes have an owner! We&#39;re still not a communist country.&#34;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lee kept me company for a good deal of the ascent. We talked about the political situation in Taiwan and the history of Ireland, and he told me that Taiwan has the best vegetarian food in the world. (To be confirmed). Lee was carrying enormous backpacks that seemed to contain the equipment for every possible eventuality on the Camino. If my appendix burst, Lee would be able to set up an operating theatre on the side of a mountain and extract it. If we were attacked by a military helicopter, Lee would have the ground-to-air missiles to take it down. His bags were so heavy that all his toenails had turned black from weeks of walking under the pressure. A useful pilgrim to know, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a relief to finally make it over the hill. I met Lee and Jana at the top, and we made our way to the collection point from where a van would bring us to the albergue, which was somewhat far from the Camino route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A view from the top of the hill.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The albergue was relatively big, with capacity for ~60 pilgrims, but that night there were only about 12 of us. The hosts provided a tasty meal that included soup, roasted vegetables, and stewed apples. I sat at a table with Marty, Jana, Lee, Stefan (a nice German guy suffering from terrible blisters), and Hannah (another Taiwanese person). The 2 French women from the albergue at Priesca were at the other table. I told my companions the tragicomic story of Max, the guy I&#39;d met at the start of the trip who thought he was being poisoned by the Georgian government. I felt a twinge of shame afterwards - was it wrong to use Max as a topic of dinner conversation? Stefan then told us about a friend of his who&#39;d been in a psychiatric hospital for 16 years, suffering from schizophrenia after a weed-induced psychotic episode. And Marty shared that he&#39;d lost his brother recently. The topics might sound a bit depressing, but I had a good time and enjoyed their company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-12-thursday-october-19th-gijon-14km-3294km-total&#34;&gt;Day 12, Thursday, October 19th, Gijón (14km, 329.4km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The van brought me, Jana, and the 2 French women back to the trail in the early hours of the morning. It was still dark and I had to navigate by my phone&#39;s torchlight. An aggressive dog barked at us from the darkness. I was afraid to proceed, not knowing if the dog was loose, but my companions gave me courage and we made it past safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked the rest of the way to Gijón with Jana, talking the whole time. We chatted about our careers (she was a social worker), our relationships back home, Palestine, and the dynamics of our families. The genocide was well under way in Gaza, and a few days previously there&#39;d been a &#34;controversy&#34; over whether or not Israel had bombed Al-Aqsa Hospital. Of course, Israel has since bombed every single hospital in Gaza without any qualms, which in hindsight makes the quibbling over Al-Aqsa seem pointless. Perhaps part of a propaganda strategy to contain the outrage while they ramped up their invasion and manufactured consent for the genocide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So absorbed was I in our conversation that I barely noticed the time passing, and suddenly we were in the outskirts of Gijón. There we bumped into Ivano, a tall, bearded Sicilian guy who was on friendly terms with Jana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;d agreed to share rooms at the GoodHouse Hotel with Lee and Hannah: me with Lee, Jana with Hannah (rhyme intended). When we arrived, I had a nap, and then I went shopping with the goal of finding the following items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a rain poncho that would cover my legs properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new baseball cap (I&#39;d left my old one behind somewhere).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new water bottle (my old one had started leaking in my bag).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmed by my multiple objectives, by the multitude of shops, and by the abundance of options in each of those shops, I only managed to buy a water bottle before the shops closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening, we (the GoodHouse Hotel Gang) went for dinner to celebrate Jana&#39;s last day on the Camino. The restaurant was called Puzzle (&#34;Why is it called Puzzle? That&#39;s the puzzle...&#34; - How I Met Your Mother). I had patatas bravas, and stewed vegetables with soup and seitan. We talked about our favourite experiences from the Camino, and Hannah recommended me &lt;em&gt;Ghost Town&lt;/em&gt;, a book by the Taiwanese author Kevin Chen. Hannah was humbled by a spicy enchilada that she assumed couldn&#39;t possibly be too much for her Asian spice tolerance. I think it was a Mexican place, though, which was not to be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-13-friday-october-20th-aviles-0km-3294km-total&#34;&gt;Day 13, Friday, October 20th, Avilés (0km, 329.4km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My left ankle was swollen and sore, so I made the executive decision to take the bus to Avilés. I didn&#39;t want to risk any further damage from walking, and I didn&#39;t want to stay in Gijón while my pilgrim pals walked on, so the bus seemed like my only option. Camino purists be damned! Also, I&#39;d heard that the walk to Avilés wasn&#39;t particularly nice, mostly consisting of ugly industrial estates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said goodbye to my companions. Jana was returning to Germany, while Lee and Hannah decided to stay on in Gijón for another night. I was sad to see Jana leave, since she&#39;d been such good company the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before departing, I bought an icepack to put on my ankle, and some ibuprofen to reduce the inflammation. The bus brought me to Avilés by around 1pm. I went straight to the albergue Pablo Solís. It was sparsely furnished, but functional. I was joined there by Aurora, Wesley, Nico the Frenchman, and Mira the Ukrainian. I was also introduced to some new pilgrims: Tony, an English guy who gave me a compression bandage to put on my ankle; Kobi, a young Dutch lad who was suffering terribly from blisters; and a Russian woman who told me she&#39;d decided on that very day to end her Camino early, due to all the rain. She had nothing to prove, she said, because she&#39;d done it before. But would someone with nothing to prove feel the need to say they have nothing to prove?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231020_174449.jpg&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The bunks in the albergue. Fascinating.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aurora &amp;amp; Wesley cooked pasta and shared it with me. I felt like a Camino beggar, since I kept taking people&#39;s food and not giving any back. Since I didn&#39;t feel like walking on my dodgy ankle, I stayed in the hostel for the rest of the evening and spent the time chatting, reading and watching brainrot videos on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-14-saturday-october-21st-cudillero-28km-3574km-total&#34;&gt;Day 14, Saturday, October 21st, Cudillero (28km, 357.4km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left Avilés around 8am, after a humble breakfast of 1 banana. As I was preparing to leave, I saw a black rat coming in and out of the main entrance, squeezing under the door to do so. How kind of them to provide shelter for the local wildlife!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aurora caught up with me before long and we walked together for a while. Without Wesley&#39;s language skills, it was hard for us to communicate with each other, but I still enjoyed her company. We managed to get by on a combination of basic French, basic English, hand gestures, and translation apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231021_143649.jpg&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Started seeing a lot of these bad boys in Asturias. They&#39;re a traditional structure for storing crops, called &lt;i&gt;hórreos&lt;/i&gt; in Spanish.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I saw Aurora and Wesley again (and Matias, the Argentinian dude) in a café. I stopped for tea and a snack, and talked to an old Spanish lady with a cute dog. Since I&#39;d been walking pretty slowly and wouldn&#39;t be able to keep up with them, I let Aurora and Wesley (henceforth A&amp;amp;W) go on without me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ankle was sore at the beginning of the day, but I didn&#39;t notice it after a while, possibly due to the ibuprofen I&#39;d taken. I encountered two loose dogs: one was friendly, the other (a mastiff) wasn&#39;t. Mastiffs were a common breed in those parts, employed to protect farm animals from wolves. This particular mastiff was guarding some goats. I also saw a few lizards. I followed the route through a wood, stepping over and ducking under fallen trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231021_090140.jpg&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;One of said fallen trees.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The world-renowned Nondescript White House.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I had to make a decision: take a detour to Cudillero, a coastal town about 1km away, where A&amp;amp;W were staying; or continue the remaining 10km until Soto de Luiñas, the designated stopping point on Buen Camino. I&#39;d already walked 27km, so I chose the shorter option. Cudillero was pretty. Its circular port was filled with boats, and colourful buildings surrounded it in concentric rings. The sea was grey, and thrashed about spiritedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231021_181649.jpg&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Cudillero. Worth the detour!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the albergue there was myself, A&amp;amp;W, Sergio (a Spanish man who&#39;d retired in the recent past; he lived in London for many years and spoke English with a London accent), Tony, and Kobi. Kobi was only 17, and Tony seemed to have taken on the role of his Camino Dad, which was cute to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us, except A&amp;amp;W, went for food and drinks. I ate padrón peppers and patatas bravas, typical Spanish tapas. Some of the peppers were VERY spicy. Sergio slagged me for ordering a caña instead of a pint - can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever understood the supposed correlation between masculinity and quantity of liquid. We discussed various topics, political and otherwise. Tony spoke a refined English, but was mostly ignorant on certain subjects, like Northern Ireland. He referred to the Republic of Ireland as Southern Ireland, instead of just Ireland - a common peeve of Irish people. He didn&#39;t seem to acknowledge the distinct identities of the component countries of the United Kingdom, and was strongly in favour of maintaining the union, for reasons of diversity, economics, etc. Sergio agreed with him - countries should remain unified! Good thing there weren&#39;t any Catalans around...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231021_181818_1.jpg&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Cudillero #2.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, despite their somewhat nationalistic opinions, we got along fine. Tony was a man of faith, and seemed to be doing the Camino for spiritual reasons. Kobi, on the other hand, was skeptical of religion. Seemed to be a bright kid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Camino diary, days 5-9</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-5-thursday-october-12th-santander-105km-1201km-total&#34;&gt;Day 5, Thursday, October 12th, Santander (10.5km, 120.1km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We departed early, after a short breakfast. I didn&#39;t sleep well due to the heat in the dorm. Aurora and Wesley left just before me, but I caught up with them after a while. I passed out 3 Spanish men on the way, more old faces from the first albergue. When they found out I was Irish, they mentioned James Joyce. I asked them who they thought was the Spanish language equivalent of Joyce. One of them said Miguel Cervantes. &#34;Isn&#39;t he more the equivalent of Shakespeare?&#34; I thought to myself, pretentiously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More walking along the coast, passing by many fields of animals. Aurora and Wesley liked to imitate animal noises, which never failed to make me laugh. Wesley took a detour at some point. In his place, we were accompanied by a Chinese guy called Wei Tee (probably a poor transcription) who was working in Barcelona. After traversing more cliffs, we came to another beach. This one was extremely long. We followed it all the way to the end, until we arrived at a town where a boat took us to Santander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;My walking buddies. I think that&#39;s Santander in the distance?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Santander, I separated from the group, which now included Wesley and Felipe, to seek out accommodation. I managed to get a spot in an albergue owned by an Asturian woman called Isabel. We chatted for a while. I told her about my experience at Padre Ernesto&#39;s. She didn&#39;t seem to be a fan of the donativo model. It&#39;s more honest, she said, to state the charge up front, rather than trying to guilt people into paying as much as possible. I agree! She also informed me that some of the construction at Padre Ernesto&#39;s had been carried out by prisoners doing community service. They probably should&#39;ve mentioned that instead of talking about everything that &#34;they&#34; had built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

     alt=&#34;An old tall ship.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A tall ship moored at Santander.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shared the room with a blunt but nice Belgian man called Stein, who described me on a phonecall as a &#34;kind Irish boy&#34;. He was from the Flemish-speaking part of Belgium. After settling in, I set off for the Santander lighthouse. My hip, which I&#39;d injured a few years before, had been niggling me on-and-off since the start of the trip. On the way to the lighthouse, it got bad enough that I started to limp. I was worried that this injury would sabotage my entire adventure, and didn&#39;t want to provoke it further, so I turned around and returned to the city centre. There, I went to a restaurant called Casimira. By coincidence, Johann and Joepke, the Dutch couple, walked past as I was sitting down to eat. They joined me for dinner and we had a nice conversation, which raised my spirits after all the worrying about my hip. I ate a tasty tortilla de patatas (Spanish omelette) and a salad. We took a selfie before they left. The following day they would be returning to the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my way back to the albergue, I ran into Ana, an Italian pilgrim who was in my dorm at Padre Ernesto&#39;s. We chatted about our lives for a while. She&#39;d just finished studying medicine at college. Having gotten a taste of the unglamorous work that is done at hospitals, and facing several more years of training at a hospital in a provincial town, she was questioning whether that was what she wanted to do anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-6-friday-october-13th-2023-santillana-del-mar-37km-1571km-total&#34;&gt;Day 6, Friday, October 13th 2023, Santillana del Mar (37km, 157.1km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day&#39;s journey would be from Santander to Santillana del Mar. It was the longest segment thus far, about 37km. Despite the long distance, and despite the prevalence of asphalt roads, and despite my concerns about my dodgy hip, everything went fine. My hip seemed to have fixed itself overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like on every other day, I saw a lot of farms and farm animals. There was also usually at least one friendly Spaniard who&#39;d shout &#34;Buen Camino!&#34; to me and other pilgrims as we walked by. I met a German woman called Maika who had started her Camino that day in Santander. I also met another Johann from the Netherlands (not Johann of Johann and Joepke fame). Johann and I walked the last part of the segment together, finally arriving in Santillana, a popular tourist town with aesthetic cobblestone streets. We went straight to the convent where we were planning to stay. It was already late in the day and all the beds were taken, so Johann and I (and Maika, who arrived shortly after us) were given mattresses on the floor to sleep on. Also staying at the convent were: Wesley and Aurora; Felipe from Sevilla; Marty the American; Nikola the monolingual Frenchman; and Stein the blunt Belgian guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After exploring the town for a bit, I returned to the convent to attend a so-called pilgrim meeting, hosted by 3 nuns. We introduced ourselves, and the nuns explained the purpose of the convent-albergue. The convent was founded in the 17th century, and in ~2016 began offering accommodation to pilgrims. They were currently employing 8 immigrant workers (asylum seekers?) at the albergue, to help them integrate into the community. We took turns doing readings from a booklet, and did a bit of singing. I&#39;m not religious, but it was an interesting experience nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;TOURISTS? On MY Camino?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, it was dinner time. I ate a tortilla, soup, and custard dessert. I thought about how much more difficult the Camino must be for vegans. By this time I also had 4 very annoying mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From chatting to Felipe and Stein, I discovered that Felipe was the head of the Spanish subsidiary of a media company called Rosco (or something like that), while Stein owned a company that employed 200 engineers. I didn&#39;t realise I&#39;d been walking among such high-powered individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;A snippet from the booklet they gave us at the pilgrim meeting. &#34;The Camino is like life&#34; - where had I heard that before? Also, from the mention of &#34;Dios&#34;, I guess the religious themes were more explicit than I remember.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disaster! There was a flood in our room. Maika woke us all up at 7am, to widespread confusion and chaos. Our mattresses hadn&#39;t soaked through, but we were completely surrounded by water. Fortunately, I&#39;d left my bag on a table, and as far as I know, nobody else had their possessions badly damaged either. I was able to slide my mattress along the floor like a raft, and got to dry ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/video&gt; 
&lt;figcaption&gt;Playing with my slidey mattress as the chaos played out around me.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cause of the flood was a massive outbreak of rain (and a broken drainpipe). It continued raining for most of the day. After heading out, my feet and legs got soaked, including parts of my shorts and underwear. This was when I discovered that my poncho didn&#39;t cover the backs of my legs properly, and also that it could only do so much to keep heavy rain off my upper body. I was physically tired from the long trek the day before, and the segment had lots of hills, so it was hard going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At various points I walked with Johann, Stein, Maika, Wesley and Aurora. Eventually, I stumbled into San Vicente de la Barquera together with Wesley and Aurora. We walked past surfers and a beach-side surf shop on the outskirts. I was exhausted and thoroughly wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked in at Albergue Nómada. I paid for the clothes washing/drying service, and later went for food (pizza) at the nearest restaurant I could find. It was a lively town, but between my tiredness and my shoes feeling like wet sponges, I wasn&#39;t motivated to explore it any further. The albergue didn&#39;t have any newspaper left for me to dry out my shoes, so instead I used tissue paper. I wasn&#39;t sure that I&#39;d have the energy to complete the 40.6km segment the next day - the longest segment I&#39;d planned to walk on the entire trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-8-sunday-october-15th-llanes-406km-2317km-total&#34;&gt;Day 8, Sunday, October 15th, Llanes  (40.6km, 231.7km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set out early after bidding farewell to Wesley and Aurora, but I got a bit lost in the maze-like streets of the town and bumped into them before finding my way out. We never agreed to team up, but we always seemed to end up walking together anyway, and by this point I felt very fond of them. I discovered that they looked a lot younger than they actually were, and that Aurora had a daughter, which I would NEVER have guessed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt well-rested, despite my misgivings the night before. We walked a lot and crossed from Cantabria into Asturias, greeted by mountains and a surprising amount of greenery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231015_160753.jpg&#34;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped to rest beside a concrete bridge. It had the acoustics of a cathedral, and we had a fun time singing and making noise under it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/video&gt; 
&lt;figcaption&gt;Aurora and Wesley under the bridge. Aurora had a surprisingly good set of pipes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met lots of animals, like always. I loved seeing them, but I also felt sadly conscious of the suffering they must have been going through as farm animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about 30km, I left Aurora and Wesley behind, because I still wanted to reach Llanes, the next stop on Buen Camino. My left foot was sore, but I foolishly pressed on, eager to arrive before dark. Unfortunately, this resulted in the emergence of my first blister of the trip. I had to ascend a mountain trail, passing through a village. Due to FOMO, I also took a brief detour to visit a cliffside viewing point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to reach Llanes, blister be damned. I went to La Casona del Peregrino for accommodation. The receptionist directed me to a restaurant called Agora, where I ate vegan Fabana (an Asturian dish) and vegan croquettes. It was very tasty and I left another 5-star review in my wake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept, or at least stayed in bed, until 8am. My roommates, two older French women and a friendly German woman called Jana, had already left by then. I delayed my departure in order to wash my clothes, put a blister plaster on my blister, and rest up a bit more. I went to the supermarket at 9am to buy tape and gauze - extra cushioning for the blister, since it was painful to walk on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was mostly by myself for the day, which was fine. I passed out Jana and the Frenchies. Also got a baby goat to eat grass out of my hand!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Some ruins.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got lost twice: the first time, I was walking along a road and missed the marker for a turn-off. The second time was more painful. I came to a fork in the route and took the branch closer to the sea, in order to catch better views. I was vaguely conscious from the Buen Camino app that this path would be longer and not as well signposted, but I didn&#39;t anticipate just how hilly it&#39;d be. As I struggled up and down a series of steep hills, my phone died, and I started to doubt whether I was even on the right path anymore. In the end, I cut across a field and made my way back to the road. I was able to follow the road the rest of the way to Ribadesella, and the relief when I arrived was sublime. The upside of the misadventure was that there were some nice cliff views, and I spotted an eagle while crossing the field. I also passed near so-called &lt;em&gt;bufones&lt;/em&gt; (&#34;fools&#34;), rock formations that launch water into the air at high pressure. The sound of the water being launched was so explosive that I initially thought it was thunder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to a bar to charge my phone, reserved a room at the hotel Covadonga, and after showering there and resting for a while, went in search of food. It was late, and the one place that my map said was open - with decent veggie options - turned out to be closed permanently. I had to resort to another restaurant nearby. It ended up costing me €18 for a low-effort salad: a few leaves of lettuce, tomatoes, and some measly bits of veg. I also had the strong suspicion that the waiter was talking shit about me with one of the other patrons. Needless to say, I did not leave a 5-star review for this establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the day, I&#39;d passed through the town of Poo. My nieces were greatly amused when I sent them a picture of the town&#39;s name on a sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-0-saturday-october-7th-2023-bilbao-0km&#34;&gt;Day 0, Saturday, October 7th 2023, Bilbao (0km)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrived in Bilbao. It was roughly 30°C outside. Decided to stay the night rather than launching straight into the journey, so I had time to visit the Guggenheim museum. There happened to be a cool Yayoi Kusama exhibition on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I went to a vegan restaurant called Veggira, which was excellent. Patatas bravas (&#34;bravas potatoes&#34;), stuffed mushrooms, red wine and a brownie with ice-cream. I happily left them a 5-star review on Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Some thematic stickers and wall art.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While walking the streets of Bilbao I came across some people playing a game. The players wore stockings over their heads, obscuring their vision, with a ball in the foot of the stocking. The goal was to knock over a bottle of water by swinging their heads. Local tradition, maybe? One of the players almost fell on me. Gave me a laugh, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231007_191742.jpg&#34;

     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Some very drunk people playing the game.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Spanish was rusty, but I managed to survive all the day&#39;s interactions without anyone switching to English - woohoo! The bad news: all the reasonably-priced accommodation was booked out, so after a desperate and stressful search I had to pay €130 for a private room in a hotel called BYPILLOW Irala. The room wasn&#39;t even particularly nice. Should&#39;ve booked in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-1-sunday-october-8th-portugalete-201km&#34;&gt;Day 1, Sunday, October 8th, Portugalete (20.1km)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first day of walking. I used the map in the Buen Camino app to find my way to the route, which was only 2 blocks from my hotel. Saw my first blue and yellow camino marker! The marker depicted a scallop shell instead of an arrow. Confusingly, it wasn&#39;t clear which direction the shell was pointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231008_112643_1.jpg&#34;

     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Is it pointing right, or left? I think it was left. Actually, I think the blue part was supposed to be the arrow, not the shell, but I never figured that out.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making my way out of the city, I had to climb a tall hill. My arse was thoroughly sore afterwards. Nice views of Bilbao, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the hill, there was a small monastery. Two cats lived there, and throughout the day I also saw horses, sheep, donkeys, and other animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrived at my first &lt;em&gt;albergue de peregrinos&lt;/em&gt; (pilgrim hostel? pilgrim refuge? I&#39;m just gonna call them albergues), where I met plenty of pilgrims but didn&#39;t talk to anyone at length. Washed my clothes in a sink using my bar of soap, then hung them up to dry. Went for food, had to cross a river via a &#34;hanging bridge&#34; / cable car thing. It was cool, but also I&#39;m not sure why they didn&#39;t just build a regular bridge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ate outside, observing the Spanish street scenes in what was a fairly residential area, and drank 2 cañas of Radler. A caña is slightly less than half a pint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-2-monday-october-9th-castro-urdiales-351km-552km-total&#34;&gt;Day 2, Monday, October 9th, Castro-Urdiales (35.1km, 55.2km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&#39;t sleep well, there were sick people coughing and I was woken up twice by a mosquito buzzing in my ear. I also had to pee several times during the night thanks to those damn cañas. Then I woke up at 5am from the noise of departing pilgrims. So, I was very tired. My feelings varied between happiness and anxiety. I was still adapting to the routine, and was worried that I might get stuck paying for an overpriced hotel again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the albergue at 8am, accompanying two fellow pilgrims who invited me to join them. Before leaving, I also met Max, who, in the words of Simon and Garfunkel, was a most peculiar man. He asked me where I was from, and I returned the question. Little did I know, I was setting myself up to be bombarded with his sad life story for the whole day. It was a long story, he said. His parents were British-American, but he grew up in a series of Eastern European countries. He somehow moved on to talking about the toxicity of the Orthodox church and about how an Orthodox priest had once hit him on the head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two pilgrims I set out with: Mari, a business psychologist from Germany; and Iria (not sure about the spelling), a Galician who had a job in Santiago! She said that 1000s of pilgrims arrive in Santiago every day. As we walked, several groups of passing cyclists sent a &#34;Buen Camino!&#34; our way. We came across a colony of stray cats. They were being fed by an overly-protective woman who warned us not to go near them, when all we had done was watch them quietly. Booooo to that woman!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly afterwards, Max came walking from the opposite direction. We informed him that he was going the wrong way, so he turned around and joined us. I was the one left talking to him, as my companions seemed reluctant to do so. We arrived at a beach town where we bought supplies in a shop and rested for a bit, while Max went on ahead. Then I left my companions because, while I appreciated their company, I was planning to walk a lot that day, and I didn&#39;t want to stall for too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a diversion because fallen rocks had blocked the cliffside path ahead. When the paths rejoined, I ran into Max yet again (he had naughtily taken the blocked route) and got stuck walking with him for another couple of hours. He told me he was in a car crash at the age of 3. Both his parents died in the crash, but Vladimir Putin pulled him from the wreck and administered a life-saving dose of morphine to save his life. Then he was brought by helicopter to a Soviet military base, where he was adopted and went on to live in various Soviet states, including Armenia and Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was more. Max thought the Georgian government was out to get him. He&#39;d worked for the Georgian police for 7 years, developing tracking software, until one day, he refused his orders and got fired. Since then, they&#39;d had him poisoned several times. They&#39;d also sabotaged him by ripping tiny holes in his bag and wearing down the rubber on the soles of his shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt sorry for Max. He&#39;d clearly had a difficult life, regardless of how true his story was. His shoes were ragged, and he said his feet were covered in blisters. He was carrying two massive backpacks, and I wondered if they contained all his worldly possessions. He told me that he survived on the generosity of strangers, so perhaps the whole spiel was intended to elicit my sympathy and financial support. I didn&#39;t feel entirely comfortable in his presence, though, and he&#39;d been talking my ear off for hours, so I was relieved when it turned out that our destinations were different and we parted ways. I do feel a little guilty that I didn&#39;t do more to help him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually arrived at a cheap, 1-star hotel in Castro-Urdiales that I&#39;d booked earlier, having walked for 8 hours that day. My feet were sore. I hoped I wouldn&#39;t get blisters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-3-tuesday-october-10th-laredo-257km-809km-total&#34;&gt;Day 3, Tuesday, October 10th, Laredo (25.7km, 80.9km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day of steep slopes, sore feet, and conversations. I started at 7:30am. The scenery was eye-catching, but the route involved a lot of walking on concrete, which I felt in my feet and legs. Before this experience, I hadn&#39;t understood why walking on hard surfaces is tough on the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231010_081009_1.jpg&#34;

&lt;figcaption&gt;A grumpy cat I encountered early in the morning.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An encounter with a predator. I was walking past someone&#39;s yard when I heard the frantic clucking of chickens. A mass of feathers and flapping wings moved rapidly in my direction. I thought I was about to be attacked by some unusually violent hens, but then I caught a glimpse of a canine creature and realised that something - a dog? a wolf? - was chasing them. I dodged out of the way and hid behind the adjacent house, not wanting to go toe-to-toe with an aggressive dog or whatever it was, and not wanting to witness any chickens getting murdered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clucking died down a few seconds later and I stepped out to see what was going on, only to catch the culprit, a fox, trotting back into the yard. It spotted me and we made eye contact. After a moment I clapped my hands and it ran away. I took a brief look around to make sure there were no mortally wounded chickens lying about, then decided it would be a good idea to inform the owner in case the fox came back for another attempt. I tried knocking on several doors in the area, and when nobody answered, I stood up on a wall in order to get a better look around. At that point, I spotted a man jog-walking towards me with 4-5 dogs. I tried to explain what had happened. He probably thought I was a lunatic, and seemed more interested in getting back to his house to make sure I hadn&#39;t messed with anything. He eventually heard me out, but seemed to think the culprit was an orange cat from the neighbourhood. I was 99% certain it was a fox (&lt;em&gt;zorro&lt;/em&gt;), though. I didn&#39;t know the Spanish for &#34;clapped my hands&#34; (&lt;em&gt;dar una palmada&lt;/em&gt;), so I had to mime that part of the story. Yay for new vocabulary!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After leaving the scene, without receiving any thanks for saving the chickens, I had to climb another hill, which was rough on my now continuously-sore glutes. At the top, I met a man from Barcelona who was resting on the ground. We chatted about our respective countries and about other people we&#39;d met so far. I got some Catalan movie recommendations from him. He spoke Spanish slowly enough that I could understand him, which was nice. Later, I met an Italian woman and her mother who were doing the Camino together. The mother was suffering from all the walking and could barely muster the breath to say anything. The daughter had done the Camino several times before. She gave me a plastic yellow arrow to tie onto my bag. I didn&#39;t want to take any plastic junk, but it would&#39;ve felt rude to say no, so I was compelled to tie it to my backpack, where it remains to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually made it to Laredo, where I was hosted at an old convent by an order of nuns. It only cost €10 to stay there, and it came with breakfast. Luxurious compared to the last albergue. The nuns doing the check-ins had an air of kindness about them, and I wished I could talk to them more. I was sharing a room with a nice old American man called Marty. (There needs to be an English equivalent of &lt;em&gt;estadounidense&lt;/em&gt;, instead of having to say &#34;person from the USA&#34;). I wandered the town searching for a place with veggie food, and eventually found a bar with vegetarian burgers. The following day we would leave Laredo by boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s from this day that I have my first memory of the October 7th attack on Israel. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;d heard much about it before this point, absorbed as I was in the trip. I remember walking past a bar and seeing footage of Hamas militants attacking a kibbutz. I was mostly ignorant about the history of Palestine and the 80+ years of occupation it had been under prior to October 7th. I also had no idea of the genocide (as classified by Amnesty, a UN commission, and other international bodies) that was about to be committed in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-4-wednesday-october-11th-guemes-287km-1096km-total&#34;&gt;Day 4, Wednesday, October 11th, Güemes (28.7km, 109.6km total)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the pilgrims gathered for breakfast. We were given sponge cake, tea and coffee. My first communal meal of the Camino! Everyone filtered out of the convent and started walking towards the boat departure point, hoping to make it in time for the first crossing of the day. The walk took about 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, I introduced myself to Wesley and Aurora, a couple I recognised from the albergue in Portugalete. Wesley had actually been sleeping above me in the bunk bed there, and I had sent mental daggers his way for the (probably reasonable) amount of noise he had made in the morning. Neither of them could speak much English, and Aurora couldn&#39;t speak Spanish. Wesley fluently spoke Portuguese, Italian and French. He made heavy use of vocabulary from these languages when speaking Spanish, but somehow we were able to understand each other and got along well. Wesley was Brazilian, living in Switzerland. Aurora was French, living in Brittany. They were a Camino couple, having gotten together while doing the Camino Francés the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the beach where the boat was supposed to pick us up. Other pilgrims joined us as we waited and wrote messages in the sand. There was Felipe, a 70-something-year-old Spanish man from Sevilla who had also stayed at the albergue in Portugalete. He was dressed sportily and seemed fit for his age. Also reappearing from Portugalete was Niko, a giant, grey-bearded, monolingual French man who could often be seen speaking and laughing to himself. There were 2 young Ukrainian women from the convent - I was curious about their life situation, given that the Russian invasion of Ukraine had been launched the year before, but I wasn&#39;t sure if it would be intrusive to ask them about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boat came and brought us the short distance to Santoña. During the crossing, I enjoyed once again the buzz of pilgrim solidarity: music playing from a radio, laughter, and shared anticipation of the day&#39;s adventure. When the boat landed, however, I felt minor social anxiety due to the uncertainty of whether people expected to walk together or not. To avoid the discomfort, I awkwardly slipped away and walked ahead while the other pilgrims wandered around the landing point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The boat!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed the route along a road until I had to leave it and climb up onto some cliffs. There were beaches on either side. I sat down on a rock to rest, as my feet were pretty sore. By this point I&#39;d started following the advice that my mother had relayed to me: take a break every hour or two and air out your feet. This is supposed to help with blister prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/IMG_20231011_101042.jpg&#34;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking forward.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Argentinian guy from the boat, Matias, caught up with me. I joined him for the next part of the trek, walking barefoot along the beach. Matias came north to do the Camino after wrapping up a seasonal job as a waiter in Andalucia. Naturally, he knew about the Argentinian director Damián Szifron, although neither of us could remember his name and referred to him as the creator of &lt;em&gt;Hermanos y detectives&lt;/em&gt; (which I&#39;ve watched) and &lt;em&gt;Los simuladores&lt;/em&gt; (which I have not). Matias normally earned a living by doing 3D modelling, along with odd jobs like food delivery, but he was re-evaluating his career and wanted to do something involving the outdoors or interacting with people. He didn&#39;t seem particularly engaged in our conversation. We left each other at the end of the beach and I walked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I ran into Aurora and Wesley again. I discovered that Aurora was a farm manager. Wesley was living his life in 1-year cycles: 6 months of work, then 6 months of travel. I think he mostly worked as a chef? He left his home in Brazil at a relatively young age. His travels brought him to the US, where he spent 2 months in immigration detention. Eventually, he made his way to Italy, where his mother and siblings had relocated, and he was able to get citizenship due to an Italian connection in the family. Currently he was living in Switzerland, where he enjoyed the outdoorsy activities like paragliding. For this trip, he drove to France on his motorbike, which he deposited at Aurora&#39;s house before setting off for Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after several hours of walking in the heat on hard asphalt roads, we arrived at Cabaña del Padre Peuto, a &lt;em&gt;donativo&lt;/em&gt; albergue (donation hostel) founded by a priest called Padre Ernesto. At these donativo albergues, you pay whatever you want for food and accommodation. Ernesto set this one up on the site of his old family home. There, with the help of volunteers, he wanted to share his life philosophy with passing pilgrims. That philosophy can be summarised as &#34;life is the real Camino&#34;. The whole place had the vibe of a hippy forest retreat. I was checked in by a friendly Mexican priest called Antonio, who was volunteering there. Then I made my bed (using disposable pillow covers &amp;amp; sheets, as usual), washed my clothes, and explored the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;A snippet of the albergue exterior. I wish I got better pictures.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before dinner, we were gathered into a circular hut with wall paintings. Here, we received a 30-minute lecture on the philosophy of the albergue. Life is a Camino: there&#39;s a start and an end and challenges along the way. You shouldn&#39;t be focused on getting to the next town when there&#39;s someone at your side who needs help, yada yada. I think it&#39;s a good message, just a bit sanctimonious. A cynical thought came to mind: &#34;every trip to the shop is a Camino, there&#39;s a start and an end and challenges along the way&#34;. I noticed some hungry people checking the time. The speaker was entertaining, at least, and the volunteer translator did an impressive job of retaining so much of what he said. Normally, Padre Ernesto was the designated speaker at these lectures, but he was well over 80 years old at this point and was tired from an interview he had done earlier in the day, so he demurred. Much emphasis was placed on how it was our &#34;responsibility&#34; to pay a fair amount for the services that were provided at the albergue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/camino/padre-peuto.jpg&#34;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the talk, it was time for dinner, which turned out to be really good. Generous helpings of vegetable soup and pasta. Padre Ernesto even came to give a short speech. He told us his life story: when he was a young priest, he&#39;d spent time working in an isolated mountainside parish. He found the way of life there inspiring, particularly how the people relied on and helped each other. This greatly influenced his life philosophy. He traveled around the world in a jeep, visiting many different countries and impoverished peoples. The dining room was basically a museum of his travels and experiences, with many souvenirs and photographs. Despite my cynicism, tears came to my eyes as I thought about how Ernesto continued to spread his message, even as he approached the end of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the sense of community at this dinner. I got to meet some cool new people. Teresa, a German woman with a shaved head who had walked for 6 months from Germany. Three older Argentinian women whom Iria and other pilgrims had told me about. They were amused when I said they were Camino celebrities. One of them, Bianca, was an artist and would be doing a residency while in Spain. Then there was André, a poncho-wearing Dominican guy whom I had seen meditating on the grass earlier. Also at the dinner were many old faces: Marty; Wesley and Aurora; Johann and Joepke (a Dutch couple from the convent); Sonia and Mira (the Ukrainians); and Felipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was starting to feel more comfortable initiating conversations with people. It had felt awkward at the beginning of the trip. Something about being in a well-defined role seems to make me more confident in social situations. Working on a team project, for example, where the scope of discussion is limited and the exchanges are practical in nature. On the Camino, my role was being a pilgrim, and more often than not the other pilgrims were friendly and receptive to conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Camino diary: an introduction</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In October of 2023, I flew to Spain and walked over 600km along the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago&#34;&gt;Camino de Santiago&lt;/a&gt;. I kept a diary throughout this journey, writing in broken Spanish. Here, I&#39;ll give a brief introduction to the series of diary entries, which I have now transcribed and translated to less-broken English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Contents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-a-camino&#34;&gt;What&#39;s a Camino?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Camino de Santiago (&#34;Way of St. James&#34;) is a network of pilgrimages or walking routes. They&#39;re mostly situated in Spain, and the endpoint of all the routes is Santiago de Compostela, a city in the autonomous community of Galicia. Hundreds of thousands of people walk these routes every year. Some of them do it for spiritual reasons, but nowadays I think most people just do it for fun. The tradition is over 1000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-did-you-do-it&#34;&gt;Why did you do it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t remember how I discovered the Camino. A lot of people, especially from North America, first hear of it through a Martin Sheen movie called &lt;em&gt;The Way&lt;/em&gt;, but I haven&#39;t watched it. Someone probably mentioned it to me during the 3-month Spanish course I did in Valencia. Wherever I got the idea, I&#39;d been excited by it for a long time (adventure! introspection! nature! Spanish!), and after submitting my thesis in September of 2025 it seemed like the perfect time to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;which-route-did-you-take&#34;&gt;Which route did you take?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Camino del Norte, or &#34;Northern Way&#34;, is a route along the coast of northern Spain. I picked it because it&#39;s less crowded than the the most popular route, the Camino Francés (&#34;French Way&#34;). I thought the pilgrims taking that route might be more interesting, and it&#39;d be less touristy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--I&#39;m not sure if this comes from a nonconformist streak or what, but I often seem to pick options from the 2nd tier of popularity. I studied Spanish in Valencia instead of Madrid or Barcelona; in school, I joined the underpopulated German class rather than one of the many crowded French classes; and my favourite programming language is the underappreciated Common Lisp. On the other hand, I follow the recommendations of others when it comes to movies, books, music and food.--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Norte starts in Irún, in the Basque Country of northeastern Spain. It consists of about 35 stages, depending on how you break it up. Given that I only had 30ish days to spend, I decided to skip a few stages and start in Bilbao instead. This shaved off about 150km, which happened to be the most mountainous and difficult part of the Norte, but I still had to walk over 600km.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the stops I &lt;em&gt;planned&lt;/em&gt; to make along the way, with particularly difficult segments marked by an X. The total distance was 667.8km.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bilbao&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portugalete (19.4km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Castro Urdiales (25.4km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laredo (25.8km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guemes (29km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Santander (15.2km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Santillana del Mar (X 37km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comillas (22km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colombres (28.8km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Llanes (23.2km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ribadesella (31.4km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sebrayo (X 31.6km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gijón (X 35.8km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avilés (25.4km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muros de Nalón (23.2km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soto de Luiña (15.3km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cadavedo (18.5km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luarca (15.3km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;La Caridad (30.5km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ribadeo (21.6km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lourenzá (X 28.4km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abadín (25.2km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vilalba (20.7km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baamonde (18.6km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sobrado (X 39.8km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arzúa (22km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pedrouzo (19.3km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Santiago de Compostela (19.4km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this isn&#39;t the precise route I ended up following, and I actually got to Santiago ahead of schedule. A few reasons why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For one segment, I took the bus instead of walking, because I had a minor injury and wanted to rest. This earned me a scoff from an annoying Camino purist or two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Among the tools I used for navigation was the Buen Camino app on my phone. I didn&#39;t realise that the stages in the app were different to the stages I&#39;d copied from pilgrim.es, and so I accidentally ended up following the app&#39;s much more ambitious schedule for the first few days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were a few branching paths that I hadn&#39;t anticipated. Sometimes I took a more scenic route, sometimes I took a shortcut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a few days to spare at the end, which I used to explore Santiago and visit Finisterre. I envisioned myself reading Sylvia Plath&#39;s poem of the same name, &lt;em&gt;Finisterre&lt;/em&gt;, in the final moments of the trip. [Editor&#39;s note: well, aren&#39;t you a pretentious little sod?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-did-you-pack&#34;&gt;What did you pack?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a relatively small backpack, with a capacity of 22L. It weighed 4-6kg, depending on whether my water bottle was full and whether I was carrying food. Many other pilgrims commented on how small and light my bag was. It was a conscious choice - all the guides said to be minimalist and reduce weight as much as possible. I may have taken it a bit too far, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the full list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;22L backpack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 pairs of socks (merino wool, helps to avoid blisters).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 pairs of underwear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 t-shirts (synthetic material, dries faster).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 pair of shorts (hiking shorts, dry quickly).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trail runners (breathable, good foot support, dry quickly when wet).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rain poncho (keeps bag and upper body dry).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;light jumper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scarf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;baseball cap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sunglasses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;microfiber towel (dries fast).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passport.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;water bottle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pharmacy stuff (in a plastic bag): suncream, paracetamol, antihistamines, insect spray, blister plasters / bandages, vaseline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;toothbrush and toothpaste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a bar of soap (for washing self + clothes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;phone/charger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;converter for sockets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;e-reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;journal + pen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 safety pins (for hanging wet clothes off the backpack when walking).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are some things I might change with hindsight, I feel that the packing was a success! Possible amendments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I probably should&#39;ve brought another pair of shorts, because with only 1 pair I needed a private room in order to wash and dry them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The scarf came in useful on one or two particularly chilly mornings, but mostly felt like a waste of space. And I looked kinda ridiculous wearing a scarf with shorts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would&#39;ve been good to have a container for my soap, because it made a mess when wet. I kept it in its original, papery container, which had almost completely disintegrated by the end of the trip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sunglasses weren&#39;t needed when I had a baseball cap. As it happened, though, I lost the baseball cap and the sunglasses got some use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I only read ~100 pages on the e-reader (&lt;em&gt;Los detectives salvajes&lt;/em&gt; was a slog), but I would be reluctant to give it up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earphones would&#39;ve been helpful on days when I was extremely bored, but I didn&#39;t bring them because &#34;living in the moment&#34;... or something. I ended up daydreaming a lot and not paying attention to my surroundings, so I probably should&#39;ve just brought earphones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some pilgrims marvelled at my lack of a sleeping bag, and a few albergues (hostels) didn&#39;t provide a blanket at night, but I managed to survive the cold by draping my towel &amp;amp; jumper over myself. I&#39;d suggest bringing a light sleeping bag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-did-you-plan-the-trip&#34;&gt;How did you plan the trip?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main resource was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/CaminoDeSantiago/&#34;&gt;r/CaminoDeSantiago&lt;/a&gt;. The discussions and guides on there cover everything you might need: routes, packing, walking tips, accommodation, weather, blister prevention, etc. I also used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pilgrim.es/en/northern-way/&#34;&gt;pilgrim.es&lt;/a&gt; for route planning, and the Buen Camino app was helpful too. I didn&#39;t book any accommodation before the trip, which ended up biting me on the first night. After that, I sometimes booked accommodation ahead of my arrival in a town, but that mostly wasn&#39;t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-kept-a-diary-wow-loser&#34;&gt;You kept a diary? Wow, loser.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. Almost every day. And I always went back to fill in the days I missed. It was a lot of work, but I didn&#39;t have much else to do in the evenings, and I&#39;m glad to now have a record of my trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote in Spanish, for practice. This somewhat limited what I could express, but I usually managed to capture the day&#39;s events with the generous use of a dictionary. I wrote in a mixture of present and past tense, but for the transcription I&#39;m converting everything to the past tense, because otherwise it&#39;d be hard to read. I&#39;ve also done extensive editing, moved some non-chronological bits around, and added details that I neglected to write down at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-did-you-eat&#34;&gt;What did you eat?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time I did the Camino, I was vegetarian. Sometimes I had to settle for subpar or expensive veggie food, especially in small villages, but for the most part I didn&#39;t have any issues. I ate a LOT of tortilla de patatas (Spanish omelette), as they&#39;re available in all the cafeterías. It would&#39;ve been much harder as a vegan. I suspect I would&#39;ve had to cook for myself a lot more and carry more food supplies with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-are-you-writing-this&#34;&gt;Why are you writing this?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems a shame to write so much and not share it with anyone. Also, it&#39;s fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>An Earnest Guide to Symbols in Common Lisp</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lisp programs have an extremely simple syntax, where everything is either a list or an atom. The most common type of atom is the &lt;strong&gt;symbol&lt;/strong&gt;, which is used to give names to things like variables and functions. In the Common Lisp code below, &lt;code&gt;defun&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pie&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; are all symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;pie&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The symbol might be a simple data structure, but its interaction with other parts of Common Lisp - packages, the Lisp Reader, macros - is complicated. This article is a vaguely FAQ-like exploration of symbols and packages that will hopefully illuminate some of these tricky interactions. Worth reading before, after, or in parallel, is (PDF warning) &lt;a href=&#34;https://flownet.com/ron/packages.pdf&#34;&gt;The Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide to Common Lisp Packages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-symbol&#34;&gt;What is a symbol?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to definitions, it&#39;s helpful to consult Common Lisp&#39;s ANSI specification, published in 1994. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/t_symbol.htm&#34;&gt;Quote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbols are used [...] to name various entities in Common Lisp, including (but not limited to) linguistic entities such as variables and functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, a symbol is a data structure for identifying things. It&#39;s important to emphasise that &lt;strong&gt;symbols are not strings&lt;/strong&gt;. Each symbol has an associated name, which is represented as a string, but the symbol itself is not a string. I point this out because strings are the closest primitive data type to symbols in most other programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-to-be-done-with-symbols&#34;&gt;What is to be done... with symbols?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we enter just &#34;x&#34; at the REPL, the symbol of that name will be evaluated, with the result being the &lt;strong&gt;value&lt;/strong&gt; referred to by that symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defparameter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;[...]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get at the symbol itself, we need to &lt;code&gt;quote&lt;/code&gt; it so that it doesn&#39;t get evaluated, like &lt;code&gt;(quote x)&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;&#39;x&lt;/code&gt; for short. Let&#39;s use this knowledge to test the statement above, that a symbol is NOT the same as its name. We need the &lt;code&gt;symbol-name&lt;/code&gt; function to fetch the name from a symbol data structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;type-of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;SYMBOL&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbol-name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;X&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;equal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbol-name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;NIL&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;; not equal!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At read time, when the raw Lisp code is slurped in and parsed, all occurrences of a particular name are mapped to a single, unique symbol. And so, in the next example, we&#39;re comparing the same symbol to itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;equal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;; equal&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common Lisp follows the &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4578574/what-is-the-difference-between-lisp-1-and-lisp-2&#34;&gt;Lisp-2 model&lt;/a&gt;, so functions and variables have separate namespaces. As such, a symbol can simultaneously identify both a function, which we fetch with &lt;code&gt;symbol-function&lt;/code&gt;, and a variable, which we fetch with &lt;code&gt;symbol-value&lt;/code&gt;. In the following example, the symbol &lt;code&gt;porridge&lt;/code&gt; refers to both a function and a variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;;; Define function.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;porridge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;[...]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;;; Define variable.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defparameter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;porridge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;[...]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;;; Symbol now refers to both a function and a variable.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbol-value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;porridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbol-function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;porridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;FUNCTION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;PORRIDGE&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;;; Compare the above to evaluating the symbol...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;porridge&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;;; ...or invoking the function it identifies.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;porridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(boundp &#39;s)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(fboundp &#39;s)&lt;/code&gt; identify whether the symbol &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is currently bound to a value or function, respectively. &lt;code&gt;(makunbound &#39;s)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(fmakunbound &#39;s)&lt;/code&gt; remove the binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defparameter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;boundp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;fboundp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;NIL&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;makunbound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;[...]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;boundp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;NIL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each symbol also has an associated &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/26_glo_p.htm#property_list&#34;&gt;property list&lt;/a&gt;, accessed with &lt;code&gt;symbol-plist&lt;/code&gt;, but that doesn&#39;t rear its head very often. There&#39;s also &lt;code&gt;symbol-package&lt;/code&gt;, which we&#39;ll discuss later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-the-symbol-name-in-all-caps&#34;&gt;Why is the symbol name in all-caps?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good catch: we entered the symbol &lt;code&gt;&#39;x&lt;/code&gt;, but the printed symbol name was &lt;code&gt;&#34;X&#34;&lt;/code&gt;. By default, all symbol names are converted to upper case by the so-called Lisp Reader. This can be controlled with a parameter called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/23_ab.htm&#34;&gt;readtable-case&lt;/a&gt;, which, if you really want to preserve your precious little capitalisation, can be set to &lt;code&gt;:preserve&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I think this is one of the language&#39;s biggest warts. Under the default behaviour, if you&#39;re trying to implement a formula that contains - &lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt; - both &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; AND &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;, you&#39;re reduced to mutating one of the names, as if you were a wretched internet user trying to meet password requirements by going from &#34;password&#34; to &#34;Password1!&#34;. I&#39;m not sure why this behaviour was chosen as the default, but usually such things can be blamed on the ANSI standard having to maintain backward compatibility with pre-existing Lisp dialects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there&#39;s a way to preserve case in symbol names regardless of &lt;code&gt;readtable-case&lt;/code&gt;. Wrap the name in &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;s, like &lt;code&gt;&#39;|x|&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbol-name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;|hi|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;hi&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;hi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;|hi|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;NIL&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;; they have different names&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;_-is-a-symbol&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;_%&amp;amp;? is a symbol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules for symbol names are somewhat unusual, compared to other programming languages. Case in point: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;_%&amp;amp;?&lt;/code&gt; is a valid symbol name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbol-name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;lt;_%&amp;amp;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;_%&amp;amp;?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are these rules? They&#39;re described in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/02_a.htm&#34;&gt;Section 2.1&lt;/a&gt; of the spec, and were admirably summarised by ScottBurson on Reddit -- now reproduced here with their permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any consecutive sequence of characters will be parsed as a symbol, except:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whitespace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parentheses/braces/brackets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those that can be parsed as numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those starting with certain special characters, including &lt;code&gt;&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;`&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a single period by itself (called &#34;dot&#34;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As exceptions to these exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any sequence of characters surrounded by &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; is parsed as a symbol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the non-symbol meaning of any character (including &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;) can be suppressed by preceding it with &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the rules above, here are some valid symbols: &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;foo-bar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;_%&amp;amp;?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;23-and-me&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;|(|&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;\(&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-secrets-of-the-defun&#34;&gt;The secrets of the defun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y&#39;know how symbols have a &lt;code&gt;symbol-function&lt;/code&gt; property? We can overwrite the value of this property with &lt;code&gt;setf&lt;/code&gt;. That&#39;s essentially what &lt;code&gt;defun&lt;/code&gt; is doing behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;setf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbol-function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;porridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;[...]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;porridge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This enables us to reimplement &lt;code&gt;defun&lt;/code&gt; as a macro, a somewhat cool fact that was first demonstrated to me in the book &lt;em&gt;On Lisp&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defmacro&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;mydefun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;parameters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;setf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbol-function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;,name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;parameters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bindings-and-symbols&#34;&gt;Bindings and symbols&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on what we&#39;ve covered already, it&#39;d be reasonable to expect the following code to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbol-value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But instead this raises an error about &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; being unbound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s why: the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; form creates a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/26_glo_b.htm#binding&#34;&gt;lexical binding&lt;/a&gt; between the symbol &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and the value &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, which persists throughout the body of the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;. This is comparable to declaring a local variable in other languages. It doesn&#39;t affect the &lt;em&gt;global&lt;/em&gt; value of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, which is what &lt;code&gt;symbol-value&lt;/code&gt; attempts to retrieve, and hence the error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; has already been declared a dynamic (a.k.a. global) variable, however, then the binding created by &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; will shadow whatever global value &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; has. Other binding constructs within the language work the same way, e.g. a function parameter called &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; would also shadow the global variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defparameter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;[...]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbol-value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbol-value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The exact details around variables, bindings, lexical scope, dynamic scope, etc. are beyond the scope of this article).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#34;Wow,&#34; you might be thinking, &#34;Doesn&#39;t this make it easy to accidentally mutate a global variable?&#34;. Well, yes. That&#39;s why, similar to most other programming languages, Common Lisp has a naming convention for global variables. They&#39;re given &#34;earmuffs&#34;, so that &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;*x*&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;did-you-say-naming-conventions&#34;&gt;Did you say naming conventions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the Common Lisp community has adopted a number of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cliki.net/Naming+conventions&#34;&gt;naming conventions&lt;/a&gt;. Some that I&#39;ll highlight here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;*x*&lt;/code&gt; is a global variable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;+x+&lt;/code&gt; is a constant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;funcp&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;func-p&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;predicate&lt;/em&gt; function, i.e. it returns a truthy or falsey value. I much prefer the Scheme convention, &lt;code&gt;func?&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check out that cliki page for more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-package&#34;&gt;What is a package?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s impossible to get a full picture of how symbols work without also understanding the related concept of &lt;strong&gt;packages&lt;/strong&gt;. These are somewhat like namespaces or &#34;packages&#34; in other languages, except they&#39;re an actual data structure that we can directly query and manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/t_pkg.htm&#34;&gt;quoting&lt;/a&gt; the spec:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A package is a namespace that maps symbol names to symbols [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main use case of packages is that they allow &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; implementation of &lt;code&gt;fizzbuzz&lt;/code&gt; to live alongside &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;fizzbuzz&lt;/code&gt;. If our packages are named &lt;code&gt;apple&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;banana&lt;/code&gt;, and they both export a symbol called &lt;code&gt;fizzbuzz&lt;/code&gt; for external use, then those symbols are referenced using &lt;code&gt;apple:fizzbuzz&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;banana:fizzbuzz&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that packages don&#39;t have any notion of variables or functions, only symbols. That&#39;s why they&#39;re sometimes described as a &#34;bag of symbols&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a package has been created inside a running Lisp process, it&#39;s visible everywhere. If there&#39;s a package called &lt;code&gt;scooby&lt;/code&gt;, and it exports the symbol &lt;code&gt;doo&lt;/code&gt;, then that symbol can be referenced anywhere via &lt;code&gt;scooby:doo&lt;/code&gt;, with no restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-symbols-get-added-to-a-package&#34;&gt;How do symbols get added to a package?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Lisp Reader inhales some Lisp code, it has to map each symbol name to a symbol data structure. It does this by &#34;interning&#34; each name into the currently active package, which is designated by a global variable called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/v_pkg.htm#STpackageST&#34;&gt;*package*&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;code&gt;(intern &#34;HI&#34;)&lt;/code&gt; returns the existing symbol called &#34;hi&#34; if it already exists in &lt;code&gt;*package*&lt;/code&gt;; otherwise, it adds a new symbol named &#34;hi&#34; to &lt;code&gt;*package*&lt;/code&gt; and returns it. This behaviour ensures that each occurrence of a symbol name will map to the same symbol data structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;intern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;hi&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;|hi|&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;; note: intern doesn&amp;#39;t capitalise names&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;|hi|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;intern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;hi&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;; they&amp;#39;re the same symbol&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&#34;CL-USER&amp;gt;&#34; is the command prompt from the SLIME REPL, indicating that CL-USER is the currently active package).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programs always start in the COMMON-LISP-USER package, which also goes by the nickname CL-USER. This package gives access to all the symbols you know and love from the ANSI spec: &lt;code&gt;car&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cdr&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;defun&lt;/code&gt;, etc. We&#39;ll explore CL-USER in more detail later on. The macro &lt;code&gt;(in-package &amp;lt;package-name&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt; changes the currently active package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;vg&#34;&gt;*package*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;PACKAGE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;COMMON-LISP-USER&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;in-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:derp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;PACKAGE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;DERP&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;DERP&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;vg&#34;&gt;*package*&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;PACKAGE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;DERP&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;; DERP is now the active package&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, &lt;code&gt;intern&lt;/code&gt; adds the symbol to the currently active package, but we can specify a different package. Let&#39;s say there&#39;s a package called &lt;code&gt;BEANS&lt;/code&gt;. Then...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;;; Add symbol named TOAST to the BEANS package.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;intern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;TOAST&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;find-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;BEANS&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;BEANS::TOAST&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;; double colon because BEANS doesn&amp;#39;t export TOAST&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;;; Switch to the BEANS package.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;in-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;beans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;COMMON-LISP:PACKAGE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;BEANS&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;;; Now we can access the TOAST symbol we added earlier.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;BEANS&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;find-symbol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;TOAST&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;TOAST&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve used &lt;code&gt;find-package&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;find-symbol&lt;/code&gt; here, which are hopefully self-explanatory. We couldn&#39;t just evaluate &lt;code&gt;(quote toast)&lt;/code&gt; to verify that the symbol exists, because in the process of reading that form, the &lt;code&gt;toast&lt;/code&gt; symbol would be created and added to the active package by the Lisp Reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;print-read-consistency&#34;&gt;Print-read consistency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re confused by the printed representation of symbols, it might be due to print-read consistency, described by The Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the invariants that Common Lisp tries to maintain is a property called print-read consistency. This property says that if you print a symbol, and then read the resulting printed representation of that symbol, the result is the same symbol, with two caveats: 1) this does not apply to uninterned symbols, and 2) [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To find out the other caveat, go read the original ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in our demonstration of the &lt;code&gt;intern&lt;/code&gt; function, the &lt;code&gt;toast&lt;/code&gt; symbol was printed as &#34;BEANS::TOAST&#34; when we were in the CL-USER package, while within the BEANS package it was printed as &#34;TOAST&#34;. This is because &lt;code&gt;toast&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; to the BEANS package, and to reference it from outside the BEANS package, we have to use that double colon. If BEANS happened to export the &lt;code&gt;toast&lt;/code&gt; symbol, we&#39;d only need 1 colon and the printed representation from CL-USER would be &#34;BEANS:TOAST&#34;. &lt;em&gt;Within&lt;/em&gt; the BEANS package, we don&#39;t need a package prefix, hence why it&#39;s just &#34;TOAST&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-in-cl-user&#34;&gt;What&#39;s in CL-USER?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be nice to explore this sort of question in the SLIME inspector. If you happen to have a SLIME REPL open in Emacs, enter &lt;code&gt;(find-package &#34;COMMON-LISP-USER&#34;)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;(find-package &#34;CL-USER&#34;)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;find-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;COMMON-LISP-USER&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;PACKAGE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;COMMON-LISP-USER&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now right click on the output, click &#34;Inspect&#34;, and you should see something like the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;#&amp;lt;PACKAGE {1000013983}&amp;gt;
--------------------
Name: &amp;quot;COMMON-LISP-USER&amp;quot;
Nicknames: &amp;quot;CL-USER&amp;quot;
Documentation:
public: the default package for user code and data
Use list: COMMON-LISP, SB-ALIEN, SB-DEBUG, SB-EXT, SB-GRAY, SB-PROFILE
Used by list: [nothing here]
4 present symbols.
0 external symbols.
4 internal symbols.
1329 inherited symbols.
0 shadowed symbols.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see the package&#39;s name, its nicknames, and its documentation. Then there&#39;s the &#34;Use list&#34;, containing all the packages that COMMON-LISP-USER inherits symbols from. My CL-USER package inherits from COMMON-LISP, as well as various packages defined by the SBCL implementation of Common Lisp, which I happen to be using. The symbols from the ANSI spec live in the COMMON-LISP package, which we can confirm with &lt;code&gt;symbol-package&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbol-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;PACKAGE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;COMMON-LISP&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;code&gt;symbol-package&lt;/code&gt; tells us the &#34;home package&#34; of a symbol; that is, where it was initially interned).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next in the inspector output, we see that CL-USER has 4 &#34;present&#34; symbols, which are symbols whose home package is CL-USER. We can check which symbols those are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;do-symbols&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbol-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;find-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;CL-USER&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;~a~%&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;BEANS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;hi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;QUICKLISP-INIT&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;HI&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(In the course of evaluating this, the Lisp Reader interned another symbol, &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;, into CL-USER, and so now there are 5 present symbols).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the inspector output. CL-USER doesn&#39;t export any symbols, so all 4 (now 5) of the present symbols are &#34;internal symbols&#34;. Then there are 1329 inherited symbols from COMMON-LISP and the SBCL packages. We don&#39;t shadow any of those symbols. Shadowing allows you, for example, to define your own implementation of &lt;code&gt;car&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, but it&#39;s usually considered a bad idea, since it subverts people&#39;s expectations of what those symbols refer to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing-around-with-some-sample-packages&#34;&gt;Playing around with some sample packages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s define a package called &lt;code&gt;beatles&lt;/code&gt;. The most common way to do this is via the &lt;code&gt;defpackage&lt;/code&gt; macro, which has a number of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defpackage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;beatles&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:cl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The options we&#39;ve used here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;(:use :cl)&lt;/code&gt; -- This makes BEATLES inherit all the exported symbols from the COMMON-LISP package (nicknamed CL). You&#39;ll almost always want to do this, because otherwise you&#39;ll have to prefix all the spec-defined symbols with &lt;code&gt;cl:&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;(:export :play)&lt;/code&gt; -- Exporting a symbol makes it visible outside the package. We&#39;re going to define a &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt; function inside the BEATLES package and export the symbol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do many of these symbols have a colon as a prefix? This is a special syntax for referencing &#34;keywords&#34;, which are symbols in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/11_abc.htm&#34;&gt;KEYWORD package&lt;/a&gt;. A common use of keyword symbols is to avoid flooding a package namespace with symbols that will never be used again. If we wrote this defpackage form without keyword symbols, then symbols called &lt;code&gt;cl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt; would be pointlessy interned into the CL-USER package (or whichever package is active). In fact, as it stands, we&#39;re pointlessly interning the &lt;code&gt;beatles&lt;/code&gt; symbol. We could avoid this by writing &lt;code&gt;(defpackage :beatles ...)&lt;/code&gt; instead. The same applies for calls to &lt;code&gt;find-package&lt;/code&gt;, as &lt;code&gt;(find-package :beatles)&lt;/code&gt; works just as well as &lt;code&gt;(find-package &#39;beatles)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;(find-package &#34;BEATLES&#34;)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let&#39;s now define some functions in the BEATLES package. Since the &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt; symbol is exported, the function it identifies will be available outside the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;in-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;beatles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;; or (in-package :beatles)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;badum tss~%&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;sing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;she loves you yeah yeah yeah~%&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&#39;s define another package, STONES, which inherits symbols from the BEATLES package as well as CL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defpackage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:stones&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:cl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:beatles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;in-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:stones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;sing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;something something paint it black~%&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This diagram represents how I think about packages. I will be gravely insulted if you don&#39;t find it helpful. The stickperson represents the active package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/cl-packages/example.png&#34;
     alt=&#34;3 boxes labelled &#39;common-lisp-user&#39;, &#39;beatles&#39; and &#39;stones&#39;. The first contains a stick figure and a few symbols: &#39;car, &#39;cdr, etc. The &#39;beatles&#39; box contains &#39;play, &#39;sing, &#39;car (from CL), etc. The &#39;stones box contains &#39;play (from &#39;beatles&#39;), &#39;sing, &#39;car (from CL), etc.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start off in CL-USER. The BEATLES package exports the &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt; symbol, so we can call the function it identifies, but we don&#39;t have access to the &lt;code&gt;sing&lt;/code&gt; symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;beatles:play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;badum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;tss&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;NIL&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;beatles:sing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;; (Error: The symbol SING is not external in the BEATLES package.)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we REALLY want to access an internal symbol from a package, we can use double colon syntax. However, it&#39;s usually a bad idea to circumvent the interface of a package like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;beatles::sing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;she&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;loves&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;yeah&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;yeah&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;yeah&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;NIL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The STONES package doesn&#39;t export any symbols, so we can&#39;t access its implementation of &lt;code&gt;sing&lt;/code&gt;. Let&#39;s try making it the active package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;in-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:stones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;PACKAGE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;STONES&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;STONES&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;vg&#34;&gt;*package*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;PACKAGE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;STONES&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since STONES inherits symbols from BEATLES, we can call the BEATLES implementation of &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt;. Also check to make sure it&#39;s really coming from BEATLES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;STONES&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;badum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;tss&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;NIL&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;STONES&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbol-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;PACKAGE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;BEATLES&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STONES didn&#39;t inherit the &lt;code&gt;sing&lt;/code&gt; symbol from BEATLES, but instead defined its own implementation of &lt;code&gt;sing&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;STONES&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;sing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;something&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;something&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;paint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;black&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;NIL&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;STONES&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbol-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;sing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;PACKAGE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;STONES&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEATLES and STONES share a single symbol by the name of &#34;PLAY&#34;, since it was interned into BEATLES and then imported by STONES. In contrast, &#34;SING&#34; was interned separately into both packages and is mapped to two distinct symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;STONES&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;find-symbol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;PLAY&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;find-symbol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;PLAY&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;find-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:beatles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;STONES&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;find-symbol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;SING&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;find-symbol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;SING&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;find-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:beatles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;NIL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;package-designators&#34;&gt;Package designators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve seen that macros/functions like &lt;code&gt;defpackage&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;find-package&lt;/code&gt; accept various data types as references to a package, including symbols, keywords and strings. These are collectively referred to as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/26_glo_p.htm#package_designator&#34;&gt;package designators&lt;/a&gt;, defined in the standard as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a designator for a package; that is, an object that denotes a package and that is one of: a string designator (denoting the package that has the string that it designates as its name or as one of its nicknames), or a package (denoting itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/26_glo_s.htm#string_designator&#34;&gt;string designator&lt;/a&gt;, in turn, is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a designator for a string; that is, an object that denotes a string and that is one of: a character (denoting a singleton string that has the character as its only element), a symbol (denoting the string that is its name), or a string (denoting itself). The intent is that this term be consistent with the behavior of string; implementations that extend string must extend the meaning of this term in a compatible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a potential gotcha. You might think that &lt;code&gt;(defpackage &#39;apple [...])&lt;/code&gt; is a valid call to &lt;code&gt;defpackage&lt;/code&gt;, because &lt;code&gt;&#39;apple&lt;/code&gt; is a symbol, which is a package designator! But actually, &lt;code&gt;&#39;apple&lt;/code&gt; is short for &lt;code&gt;(quote apple)&lt;/code&gt;, which is a list and decidedly NOT a package designator. When we &lt;em&gt;evaluate&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;(quote apple)&lt;/code&gt;, it returns the symbol called &#34;APPLE&#34;, which would be a valid package designator, but when we pass &lt;code&gt;(quote apple)&lt;/code&gt; to a macro then the macro just sees a list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-the-deal-with-the-keyword-package&#34;&gt;What&#39;s the deal with the KEYWORD package?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve already touched briefly on the KEYWORD package. In brief: keywords are symbols in the KEYWORD package, and &lt;code&gt;:blah&lt;/code&gt; is syntax sugar for &lt;code&gt;keyword:blah&lt;/code&gt;. But besides avoiding namespace pollution, what are keywords good for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/11_abc.htm&#34;&gt;Quoting the spec&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KEYWORD package contains symbols, called keywords, that are typically used as special markers in programs and their associated data expressions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few examples of keywords being used as &#34;special markers&#34;, one of which is the use of keyword parameters in functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;;; Defining a function with a keyword parameter.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;;; Here be a wild keyword!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;; ---&amp;gt; 5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another insightful quote from the spec...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbol tokens that start with a package marker are parsed by the Lisp reader as symbols in the KEYWORD package; see Section 2.3.4 (Symbols as Tokens). This makes it notationally convenient to use keywords when communicating between programs in different packages. For example, the mechanism for passing keyword parameters in a call uses keywords to name the corresponding arguments [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an example of how keywords are convenient for &#34;communicating between programs in different packages&#34;. Let&#39;s say the BEATLES package exports a &lt;code&gt;favourite&lt;/code&gt; macro that generates a print statement based on the code it receives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;in-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:beatles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defmacro&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;favourite&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;beatle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;beatle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:john&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;correct~%&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;wrong~%&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we now call this macro from the STONES package...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;STONES&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;beatles:favourite&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:john&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;correct&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;STONES&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;beatles:favourite&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:ringo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;wrong&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...it behaves as we&#39;d expect. If we&#39;d instead implemented &lt;code&gt;favourite&lt;/code&gt; using the comparison &lt;code&gt;(eq beatle &#39;john)&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;(beatles:favourite &#39;john)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(beatles:favourite &#39;ringo)&lt;/code&gt; would, perhaps surprisingly, &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; print &#34;wrong&#34;, because the &lt;code&gt;john&lt;/code&gt; symbol we&#39;d be interning into the STONES package would be different to the &lt;code&gt;john&lt;/code&gt; symbol in the BEATLES package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an act of unashamed plagiarism, here&#39;s a lazy quote of more usage advice from the spec that I thought was interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is generally best to confine the use of keywords to situations in which there are a finitely enumerable set of names to be selected between. For example, if there were two states of a light switch, they might be called :on and :off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In situations where the set of names is not finitely enumerable (i.e., where name conflicts might arise) it is frequently best to use symbols in some package other than KEYWORD so that conflicts will be naturally avoided. For example, it is generally not wise for a program to use a keyword as a property indicator, since if there were ever another program that did the same thing, each would clobber the other&#39;s data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;can-a-symbol-be-homeless&#34;&gt;Can a symbol be homeless?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve seen how symbols have a home package, which is the package into which they were originally interned. &lt;code&gt;(symbol-package &#39;sym)&lt;/code&gt; yields this package. Here are some ways in which a symbol can become orphaned, such that &lt;code&gt;(symbol-package &#39;sym)&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;NIL&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Manually create a symbol data structure: &lt;code&gt;(make-symbol &#34;NAME-HERE&#34;)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbol-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;make-symbol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;jinkies&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;NIL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Syntax sugar for homeless symbols: &lt;code&gt;&#39;#:name-here&lt;/code&gt;. Note that &lt;code&gt;(eq &#39;#:hi &#39;#:hi)&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;NIL&lt;/code&gt;, since they&#39;re different symbols that just happen to share the same name. It&#39;s only within packages that each name is mapped to a unique symbol. If you want to be miserly about the number of junk symbols you&#39;re creating, then you can use these orphan symbols to denote package and symbol names in &lt;code&gt;defpackage&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;find-package&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;in-package&lt;/code&gt; and elsewhere. I find it a bit verbose, though...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defpackage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;#:beatles&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;#:cl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;#:play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;find-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;#:beatles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;code&gt;unintern&lt;/code&gt; a symbol to remove it from a package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;find-symbol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;S&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;; it exists!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:INTERNAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;; and is not exported&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;unintern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;find-symbol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;S&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;NIL&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;; it does not exist anymore!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;NIL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;symbols-and-macros&#34;&gt;Symbols and macros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an example that should demonstrate the relationship between symbols, the Lisp Reader, and macros. Perhaps you&#39;re like me and came up with the ingenious idea of a macro that executes its body inside a certain package, before restoring the original active package. Something like...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;with-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:beatles&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&#39;s how you might imagine implementing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defmacro&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;with-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;old-pkg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;gensym&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;old-pkg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;vg&#34;&gt;*package*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;setf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;vg&#34;&gt;*package*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;find-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;setf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;vg&#34;&gt;*package*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;old-pkg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the above code should expand to something like...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;#:g690&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;vg&#34;&gt;*package*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;setf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;vg&#34;&gt;*package*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;find-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:beatles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;setf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;vg&#34;&gt;*package*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;#:g690&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...where &lt;code&gt;#:g690&lt;/code&gt; is a unique, homeless symbol produced for us by &lt;code&gt;gensym&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this idea is that it represents a misunderstanding of how code execution works in Common Lisp. For the sake of simplification, let&#39;s say that code execution consists of two stages: Reading and Evaluation. First, raw text is guzzled up by the Lisp Reader and converted to Lisp data structures. It&#39;s in this stage that symbols are created, and it&#39;s here that their home package is determined, based on the value of &lt;code&gt;*package*&lt;/code&gt; when Reading occurs. Next comes Evaluation, which begins with the expansion of all macros in the code. Macros are functions that operate on Lisp data structures and return Lisp data structures. By the time our &lt;code&gt;with-package&lt;/code&gt; macro is passed the list &lt;code&gt;((play))&lt;/code&gt; as its &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; parameter, it&#39;s already too late. The &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt; symbol has been interned in whatever package was active when the Lisp Reader did its job, probably CL-USER. It doesn&#39;t matter if, when our expanded code is being evaluated, we set &lt;code&gt;*package*&lt;/code&gt; before calling &lt;code&gt;(play)&lt;/code&gt;, because &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt; has already been interned somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that to say: the Evaluation of a form can&#39;t affect how it is read by the Lisp Reader, since Reading happens before Evaluation. We could implement something like &lt;code&gt;with-package&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;em&gt;reader macros&lt;/em&gt;, but that&#39;s a topic for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;special-symbols-t-and-nil&#34;&gt;Special symbols: T and NIL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two special symbols that evaluate to themselves: &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;. When we evaluate &lt;code&gt;(symbol-value t)&lt;/code&gt;, we get back... &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; again. These &#34;special symbols&#34; represent various things, including the boolean values true &amp;amp; false. &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; also represents the empty list, hence why &lt;code&gt;(listp nil)&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbolp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;; it&amp;#39;s a symbol!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbol-name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;T&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;; I&amp;#39;m not joking, it really is a symbol&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;; evaluates to itself!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;symbolp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;NIL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-i-compile-a-function-how-does-slime-know-which-package-its-in&#34;&gt;When I compile a function, how does SLIME know which package it&#39;s in?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re an Emacs user and you&#39;ve compiled a single Common Lisp form, like a function, using the &lt;code&gt;C-c C-c&lt;/code&gt; shortcut, then you may have wondered how SLIME knows which package should be active when the Lisp Reader slurps in that form. For example, you might have the following code in a buffer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;in-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your REPL, the currently active package is CL-USER. So when you compile the &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; function, why does it get added to the FOO package rather than CL-USER?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an implementation detail of SLIME more than anything, but I remember being confused by it, so let&#39;s indulge ourselves with this brief tangent. First, let&#39;s see which Elisp function the &lt;code&gt;C-c C-c&lt;/code&gt; shortcut is bound to. Entering the help command for keyboard shortcuts, &lt;code&gt;C-h k&lt;/code&gt;, and then &lt;code&gt;C-c C-c&lt;/code&gt;, we&#39;re told that this shortcut is bound to the function &lt;code&gt;slime-compile-defun&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function is defined in &lt;code&gt;slime.el&lt;/code&gt;. Following the link there and searching for &#34;in-package&#34;, we find the following comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the concept of the &#34;current Lisp package&#34;. RPC requests always say what package the user is making them from and the Lisp side binds that package to *BUFFER-PACKAGE* to use as it sees fit. The current package is defined as the buffer-local value of &#39;slime-buffer-package&#39; if set, and otherwise the package named by the nearest IN-PACKAGE as found by text search (cl-first backwards, then forwards).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there&#39;s our answer: unless &lt;code&gt;slime-buffer-package&lt;/code&gt; is set, SLIME first searches backwards and then forwards for the nearest IN-PACKAGE form. Not mentioned is that if no IN-PACKAGE form is found, then the code is compiled in the currently active package, whether that&#39;s CL-USER or something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For curiosity&#39;s sake, here&#39;s the Elisp function used to search for IN-PACKAGE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;slime-search-buffer-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;case-fold-search&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;regexp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;^[ \t]*(\\(cl:\\|common-lisp:\\)?in-package\\&amp;gt;[ \t&amp;#39;]*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;\\([^)]+\\)[ \t]*)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;save-excursion&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;re-search-backward&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;regexp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;re-search-forward&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;regexp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;match-string-no-properties&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Graphics livecoding in Common Lisp</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some Lisps, like Common Lisp, have a powerful feature that tends to go underappreciated amidst all the talk about macros: the ability to recompile your program while it&#39;s running, without restarting it. For the purposes of this post, and because it sounds cool, let&#39;s call this ability &lt;em&gt;livecoding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:livecod&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; href=&#34;#fn:livecod&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering this strange land where the programs never stop, we&#39;ll first take a brief tour of Common Lisp and one of its graphics frameworks, Sketch, before walking through a livecoded implementation of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids&#34;&gt;Boids algorithm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;source src=&#34;/static/img/cl-livecoding/boids-sample.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
&lt;/video&gt; 
&lt;figcaption&gt;Boids!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wait-what-exactly-is-this-livecoding-thing&#34;&gt;&#34;Wait, what exactly is this livecoding thing?&#34;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the typical workflow needed to modify a running application, like a videogame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop the application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(If a compiled language) Wait N time units for a full recompilation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the application again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fiddle with the application to get it back to its previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carry on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a livecoding environment, the application is never stopped, which eliminates steps 1, 4 and 5. Instead, small code changes (which can be as granular as recompiling a single function) are immediately reflected in the running program. Step 3 is often instantaneous because only the changed parts of the program must be recompiled. In theory, then, you can develop an entire application while it continuously runs in the background, without ever waiting for code to recompile. This makes the development process more fluid and interactive, with minimal downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Common Lisp, the workflow might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a small change to a single function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recompile the function (instantaneous).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carry on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an example of this workflow in action, check out Common Lisp and Emacs being used as an environment for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkYUU0UoB_0&#34;&gt;live musical performance&lt;/a&gt;. You can hear about a Lisp program being debugged remotely while running in &lt;a href=&#34;https://corecursive.com/lisp-in-space-with-ron-garret/&#34;&gt;deep space&lt;/a&gt;. Livecoding (or hot reloading, or whatever you like to call it) is also available in other languages, like Smalltalk and Erlang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-rough-sketch-of-sketch&#34;&gt;A rough sketch of Sketch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before jumping into Boids, let&#39;s take a brief look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vydd/sketch&#34;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt;, our Common Lisp graphics framework of choice. We&#39;ll be more concerned with big ideas than with code minutiae, but if you&#39;re unfamiliar with Common Lisp and want to understand the code samples, then please take a detour through &lt;a href=&#34;https://learnxinyminutes.com/common-lisp/&#34;&gt;Learn Common Lisp in Y Minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Sketch. The Sketch API is heavily based on that of &lt;a href=&#34;https://processing.org/&#34;&gt;Processing&lt;/a&gt;. Its primary entry point is the &lt;code&gt;defsketch&lt;/code&gt; macro. The code below defines a &#34;sketch&#34; called &lt;code&gt;my-sketch&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;defsketch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;my-sketch&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;;; ...drawing code here...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the name of the sketch comes a list of bindings that define its state and configuration. Here, the window properties &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; are set to &lt;code&gt;200&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is an attribute we&#39;ve added for our own use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then comes the drawing code. This gets run in a loop while the sketch is running, once per frame. The following snippet draws 5 red circles on a black background, each of radius 10 and in random positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;+black+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;with-pen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;make-pen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:fill&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;+red+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;circle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After painting the background black, the all-powerful &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; macro is used to draw &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; circles. The &lt;code&gt;with-pen&lt;/code&gt; macro (defined by Sketch) configures drawing properties like fill colour, stroke width and stroke colour. It takes a &#34;pen&#34; object as an argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s all the code together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;defsketch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;my-sketch&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;+black+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;with-pen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;make-pen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:fill&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;+red+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;circle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to run the sketch, we compile our code and execute &lt;code&gt;(run-sketch &#39;my-sketch)&lt;/code&gt; from the REPL, resulting in...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/cl-livecoding/sketch-sample.gif&#34;
     alt=&#34;The result: red circles flashing on a black background.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;...art.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s all we need to know about Sketch for now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;livecoding-boids&#34;&gt;Livecoding Boids&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids&#34;&gt;Boids&lt;/a&gt; is an algorithm from 1986 for simulating flocks of birds. In essence, it consists of applying 3 forces to the simulated birds. Quoting Wikipedia&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:boidsref&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; href=&#34;#fn:boidsref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, these forces are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we implement this ourselves? First, we need a canvas to draw on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;defsketch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;restart-on-change&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;gray-255&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;230&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only mysterious thing in this code is the &lt;code&gt;restart-on-change&lt;/code&gt; parameter, which is available in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/sketch&#34;&gt;fork&lt;/a&gt; of Sketch. When its value is &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; (false), the sketch&#39;s state - like the boid positions - won&#39;t be reset when we recompile our code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compiling the defsketch form in Emacs (with the Ctrl-C Ctrl-C shortcut) and executing &lt;code&gt;(run-sketch &#39;boids)&lt;/code&gt; at the REPL gives us... 🥁... a gray background. Wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/cl-livecoding/boids-1-canvas.png&#34;
     alt=&#34;A light-gray background.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: all going well, this modest window will run continuously throughout the entire development lifecycle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&#39;s create some boids to populate our world. We add a &lt;code&gt;boid&lt;/code&gt; class to store their position and velocity, as well as a convenience function &lt;code&gt;make-boid&lt;/code&gt; to create a boid from x &amp;amp; y co-ordinates. These rely on a hopefully self-explanatory implementation of 2d vectors, which are created using the &lt;code&gt;vec2&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defclass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:initarg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:pos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:accessor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;velocity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:initarg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:velocity&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:initform&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;vec2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:accessor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;velocity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;make-boid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;make-instance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;boid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:pos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;vec2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the sketch itself, we add 20 boids in random positions, and pass them to the &lt;code&gt;draw-boids&lt;/code&gt; function in the drawing loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;defsketch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;restart-on-change&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;     &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;                  &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;collect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;make-boid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;gray-255&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;230&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;draw-boids&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we then recompile defsketch (with Ctrl-C Ctrl-C)... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video loop autoplay muted class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;/static/video/cl-livecoding/boids-2-missing-draw-compile.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...we get an error! Woops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;video loop autoplay muted class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;

&lt;/video&gt; 
&lt;figcaption&gt;Before: gray canvas. After: red error screen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course! We forgot to define &lt;code&gt;draw-boids&lt;/code&gt;. The program doesn&#39;t crash, however, and we&#39;ll soon be able to recover from this setback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an implementation of &lt;code&gt;draw-boids&lt;/code&gt;. We don&#39;t need to get into the weeds of how it works. For each boid, it does some unwieldy vector math to figure out which direction the boid is facing and draws a triangle pointing in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;draw-boids&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid-width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid-length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;

               &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;with-pen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ss&#34;&gt;:fill&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;+black+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;let*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;zerop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;v-length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;velocity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as we compile &lt;code&gt;draw-boids&lt;/code&gt;, the error screen disappears and our lovely boids are drawn into place. And we didn&#39;t have to restart the program to fix it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;video loop autoplay muted class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;/static/video/cl-livecoding/boids-3-define-draw.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
&lt;/video&gt; 
&lt;figcaption&gt;Before: red error screen. After: boids are drawn.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two Common Lisp features that enable us to fix errors on-the-fly like we&#39;ve done here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newly compiled code, and recompiled code, is immediately loaded (sometimes called &#34;hot reloading&#34;) into the running program. This opens up possibilities such as optimising a program as it runs, tweaking parameters like gravitational force and background colour, and iteratively developing a GUI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The condition system! This is somewhat like exception handling in other languages, but more powerful. Not only can we signal exceptional situations (&#34;conditions&#34;), but we can also define &#34;restarts&#34; for recovering from those situations. When a running Common Lisp program encounters an unhandled condition, control passes to the debugger, and the user is presented with a selection of restarts. Perhaps they want to recompile the offending function and continue execution from the previous stack frame. Or perhaps the error was a division by zero, and the offending function provides a restart that swaps in a value of 1 for the divisor. Suddenly, there are a lot more possibilities than just crashing the program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a worthy discussion of the condition system would take up a full blog post of its own. Back to Boids!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that our boids are drawn correctly, we want them to move around and do boid things. First, we implement an &lt;code&gt;update-positions&lt;/code&gt; function, which basically adds the velocity of each boid to its position (so that the boid moves), and applies the 3 Boidian forces to update the boid&#39;s velocity. For now, the functions implementing these forces are stubbed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;update-positions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;max-velocity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;;; Update boid positions.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;setf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;v+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;velocity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))))&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;;; Update boid velocities.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;;; Stubs! (For now).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;rule1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;vec2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;rule2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;vec2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;rule3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;vec2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then have to modify the drawing loop to call &lt;code&gt;update-positions&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;defsketch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;restart-on-change&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;collect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;make-boid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                                     &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;gray-255&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;230&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;draw-boids&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;update-positions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, these changes haven&#39;t affected the boid behaviour, so let&#39;s circle back and implement &lt;code&gt;rule-1&lt;/code&gt;, which can be summarised as &#34;stay away from other boids&#34;. When a boid is less than 10 pixels from another boid, we push them away from each other to avoid crowding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;rule1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;v-sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;vec2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;   &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;         &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;v-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;         &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;dist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;v-length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;         &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;dist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;           &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;v+!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;v-sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;   &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;v-sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: the vector functions ending in &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;, like &lt;code&gt;v+!&lt;/code&gt;, follow the convention of storing the result in the vector passed as the first argument).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we recompile this function...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video loop autoplay muted class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;/static/video/cl-livecoding/boids-4-first-rule.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...a pair of boids that happen to be too close to each other are sent flying off into the void. There&#39;s no counterforce to bring them back, just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we implement &lt;code&gt;rule-2&lt;/code&gt;: boids should fly towards the average position of other boids. Our implementation could be more efficient by summing the boid positions just once, rather than doing it for every single boid, but I can&#39;t be bothered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;rule2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;vec2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;         &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;           &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;v-scale!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;1-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;v-!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;v-scale!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recompiling &lt;code&gt;rule-2&lt;/code&gt;, we get...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video loop autoplay muted class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;/static/video/cl-livecoding/boids-5-second-rule.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! This is starting to look vaguely like Boids. Let&#39;s add the final rule, &lt;code&gt;rule-3&lt;/code&gt;: boids should match their velocity to all the other boids. Implementation note: we probably shouldn&#39;t update the velocities until all the new velocities have been calculated, but this doesn&#39;t seem to matter too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;rule3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;boids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;hll&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;vec2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recompiling, we see the Boids calm down a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it&#39;s not very bird-like to fly around in a vortex of death, we could also give the boids a purpose by making them follow the mouse position. The result of these changes can be seen at the top of the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that, we have a complete implementation of Boids! At the risk of beating a dead horse, I&#39;ll re-emphasise that we did the whole thing without once restarting our program or waiting a perceivable amount of time for code to compile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;closing-thoughts&#34;&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope, in this brief demonstration of livecoding, I&#39;ve given you a taste of how useful and fun this feature can be, whether you&#39;re developing a graphics application or mundane accounting software. Like I&#39;ve said, it&#39;s not unique to Common Lisp, as at least Smalltalk and Erlang have similar capabilities. It&#39;s also possible to bridge the gap in less interactive languages by making applications automatically restart themselves when a code change is detected, or by bolting on a scripting language. Just do me a favour and ask yourself, the next time you&#39;re waiting the requisite time units for your code to recompile: &lt;em&gt;How can I make this workflow more interactive? How can I make it more... like Common Lisp?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chess Detective: Identifying player profiles from Lichess recaps</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I posted &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/chess-ratings.html&#34;&gt;an analysis&lt;/a&gt; of Lichess data, with the aim of figuring out what a &#34;normal&#34; rating fluctuation looks like. It was a garbage piece of work, because I was too lazy to properly clean the data. Another time, I &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/rc8.html&#34;&gt;paired up&lt;/a&gt; with someone at the Recurse Center to do some baby reverse engineering of the Lichess network protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we return to Lichess, that most noble of chess websites, with a different objective in mind. Lichess recently released a summary of the year for each player: how many games they played, who their most-played opponent was, and so on. Spotify Wrapped for chess, basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/chess-detective/lichess-recap.png&#34;
     alt=&#34;My Lichess recap for 2024. 2084 games played, 73484 moves played, 8 days and 16 hours spent playing, favourite time control was blitz, Ivanomran most played opponent, 170 puzzles solved, Sicilian Defence Alapin Variation most-played opening as white, Caro-Kann Defence Exchange Variation most-played as black.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;My Lichess Wrapped™.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was struck by the question of whether it&#39;s possible to identify someone&#39;s profile based on the summary page of their Lichess recap. This turned out to be a lot easier than I expected, as all we really need to know is the most-played opponent and the number of games played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all starts with the Lichess API. Lichess offers the following HTTPS endpoint for fetching someone&#39;s games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://lichess.org/api/games/user/BLAH?since=1590969600000&amp;amp;until=1591833599999
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;BLAH&lt;/code&gt; is the username, while &lt;code&gt;since&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;until&lt;/code&gt; specify the time period. Those numbers are unix timestamps, in milliseconds -- that is, the number of milliseconds that have passed since January 1st 1970. We can write a convenience function to spit out the unix timestamp for a given date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;epoch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;strptime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;%Y-%m-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;%d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;timestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# REPL test.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;epoch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;2024-01-01&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1704067200000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is all Python, by the way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, another convenience function. This one assembles the URL and query string, given a username and range of dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;get_lichess_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;start_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;end_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;https://lichess.org/api/games/user/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;?since=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;epoch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;start_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;amp;until=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;epoch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;end_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;get_lichess_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;BlunderJan&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;2024-01-01&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;2025-01-01&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;https://lichess.org/api/games/user/BlunderJan?[...]&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&#39;s a 1-line function to download all of someone&#39;s games in a given year, using the &lt;code&gt;requests&lt;/code&gt; library and the convenience function we wrote before. The return value of this function, &lt;code&gt;r.content&lt;/code&gt;, should be a bytestring containing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation&#34;&gt;PGN&lt;/a&gt; (Portable Game Notation) data for all the games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;download_games&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;get_lichess_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;-01-01&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;-01-01&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;download_games&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;kpgiskpg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;2024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# it&amp;#39;s me!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;[Event &amp;quot;Rated bullet game&amp;quot;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;[Site &amp;quot;https://lichess.org/3sEETUVO&amp;quot;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;[...]&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we have the PGN data stored in a variable called &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;. The following code reads all the games contained therein and counts how many times the given user (the most-played opponent of our mystery profile) played each opponent. We use the &lt;code&gt;chess&lt;/code&gt; package to read PGN data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;chess.pgn&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;io&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;StringIO&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;defaultdict&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# The chess API expects to receive a stream of characters, so first&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# convert the bytestring to a string and then wrap it in a streamy thing.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;stream&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;StringIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Like a regular dictionary, but if a key (i.e. a username) isn&amp;#39;t present&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# when we try to access it, then defaultdict gives it an initial value of 0.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;counts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;defaultdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;game&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;chess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pgn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;read_game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;game&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ow&#34;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Add 1 to the game count for the player who IS NOT the&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# player whose games we&amp;#39;re analysing.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;counts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Black&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;White&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;kpgiskpg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;White&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we create a ranked list of all the opponents based on the number of games played, and display them. This &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; gives us the result: if user B is user A&#39;s most-played opponent, then user A is likely to be high in the ranking of user B&#39;s opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ranked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;sorted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;counts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ranked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;MostPlayedOpponent&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;12345&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;SecondMostPlayedOpponent&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;12344&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we wanted, we could then iterate through these players until we found someone who played exactly the number of games shown in the recap, reusing our &lt;code&gt;download_games&lt;/code&gt; function to calculate that. I&#39;m going to stop here, however, because... well... let&#39;s say, hypothetically, that I was curious to find someone&#39;s Lichess profile, and that, hypothetically, at this point in the search, a username turned up near the top of the list that was obviously theirs. While that&#39;s just a hypothetical scenario, the last piece of the puzzle is still left as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story: if you want to share your Lichess recap without revealing your Lichess profile, then you should obscure the most-played opponent. Another thing you should probably do is add a random offset to all the numbers in the recap, since they could also be used to uniquely identify your profile if someone is obsessed enough to trawl through the entire Lichess userbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, this is my 50th blog post! Woohoo! 🎉 Stay tuned for post #51, which will be about graphics livecoding with Common Lisp.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I spent 12 weeks at a programming retreat called the Recurse Center (RC). I wrote about the &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/recurse.html&#34;&gt;application process&lt;/a&gt;, and I shared a series of &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/tag/rc.html&#34;&gt;daily updates&lt;/a&gt; from my time there. Now, I&#39;d like to write what they playfully call a &#34;return statement&#34; and reflect on the experience as a whole&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:return&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; href=&#34;#fn:return&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We&#39;ll cover the highs, the lows, and the minutiae of life at RC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, here&#39;s a list of everything I did during my batch. Certain projects, like the BitTorrent client, spanned almost the entire 12 weeks, but most were mini-projects. Micro-projects, even!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made several toy graphics applications: a visualisation of the Lorenz attractor, a slice of toast that always lands on the jammy side, a giraffe that executes a stack-based programming language, and randomly-generated trees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributed a few pull requests to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vydd/sketch&#34;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt;, the Common Lisp graphics framework. Also contributed some documentation to the Common Lisp Cookbook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made my own &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/cl-bittorrent&#34;&gt;BitTorrent client&lt;/a&gt;. This involved a parser for the bencoding format, a multi-threaded client for communicating with multiple peers at once, networking code for (de)serialising messages and sending them over sockets, and the actual logic for dealing with peers. The final result was an unoptimised, fragile mess, but I was able to transfer a file to myself!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved my Emacs workflow. (Thanks to Reed, Thomas, and others. Magit is AWESOME).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tried music programming with SuperCollider, and attended the SuperCollider workshops run by Zack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked through several chapters of the Book of Shaders. This was my first significant experience writing shader programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read a lot about the workings of Forth and got part of the way to implementing a basic &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/cloroforth&#34;&gt;Forth interpreter&lt;/a&gt; - to be continued!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read a few chapters of Learn You a Haskell and learned what a monoid is. (Already forgotten).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrote C code that could call assembly, and vice versa. To my surprise, this was moreso about understanding the compilation and linking process, than needing to write any particularly fancy code. Also learned a bit about the ELF format for executables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made a &lt;a href=&#34;/apps/tuner.html&#34;&gt;shitty guitar tuner&lt;/a&gt; in less than 1KB, with the help of Charlie. More precisely, it&#39;s 903 bytes of HTML and JavaScript. The audio breaks when I play it on my phone, so I need to figure out how to adjust the gain for different devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visited the Center for Computing History and wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/center-computing.html&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paired with Thomas on refactoring my barely-started &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/hidl&#34;&gt;computer emulator&lt;/a&gt; project, which is based on the book &lt;em&gt;Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figured out the Lichess network protocol with Raghav. (JSON-encoded messages sent over websockets). We hooked into the DOM and managed to make a chess piece move by entering a message in the chatbox. I also learned a bit about WireShark and TCP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dipped my toe into some hacking challenges (MicroCorruption, Hacker101 CTF).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paired with Elias to implement the Luhn algorithm in J, for validating credit card numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made tweaks to my website, like adding previous/next links to blog posts. This has turned out to be more of a pain than I realised, and my implementation still has a bug.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Began my study of data science, working through a chapter of &lt;em&gt;Learning from Data&lt;/em&gt; and some of Andrew Ng&#39;s lectures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pair-programmed with many other people not mentioned above. Examples of their projects: a Paxos protocol implementation, a chess engine, a ray tracer, a WebRTC implementation, CryptoPals, and an interpreter in Clojure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended weekly project presentations, and gave two presentations of my own: one on C-calling-assembly-calling-C, and one on the BitTorrent client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had many &#34;coffee chats&#34; and discussions over Zoom with other Recursers. Also attended many Recurser-run events: a TIC-80 tour, the SuperCollider workshops, Graphics Goblins, ...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended RC-run events that were intended to help us make the most of the experience, e.g. the Building Your Volitional Muscles workshop helps you figure out what to work on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were also quite a few non-programming-related events, like Will&#39;s burnout talk, the feelings check-ins, and &#34;any topic is allowed&#34; presentations (can&#39;t remember what those were called).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/recurse.html&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; from just before I started RC, you&#39;ll notice that I didn&#39;t get around to implementing even a fraction of the ideas I&#39;d brainstormed. I didn&#39;t make a game, write a machine code-generating compiler, or learn anything about operating systems, to name a few projects I missed. In any case, I&#39;m happy with the variety of things I worked on. I got a taste for lots of different technical subjects that I&#39;d always wanted to try. (Hacking! Network programming! Graphics!). I also enjoyed following along with the massive range of projects that other people were working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staff have done a great job cultivating a pleasant environment at RC. It&#39;s probably the most welcoming tech space I&#39;ve ever been part of. Every time I reached out to one of my batchmates, I got a friendly response. They were an interesting group of people, coming from backgrounds as diverse as English literature, music and physics. But most importantly, they were kind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pair programming is highly encouraged at RC. It&#39;s a great way to spend time with people, learn from them, and get a taste for their projects. It helped to take the initiative in asking people to pair or to chat; if I hadn&#39;t done so, then I probably would&#39;ve spent most of the batch working alone! Another RC tradition is the &#34;niceties&#34;. People are encouraged to write each other nice messages when each batch ends. Then, in the &#34;never graduate&#34; ceremony, the faculty read aloud a single hand-picked nicety for each Recurser. It&#39;s a cute way to end the experience. My batch was the first one where they introduced a portal for sending and receiving niceties, where the niceties will be stored &lt;em&gt;for eternity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the structure of the retreat, we were mostly left to figure things out for ourselves. The RC faculty and infrastructure enable you to make RC what you want it to be, though it&#39;s strongly encouraged to work during the office hours and to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.recurse.com/self-directives&#34;&gt;Learn Generously&lt;/a&gt;. You can work on whatever you want, attend as many events as you want, and interact with other people as much as you want. Helpful stuff includes: Zulip for text chat (with its excellent selection of emojis 🐙), a calendar for organising events, Virtual RC/conference rooms for video &amp;amp; audio chats, staff-run events, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure meant I could attend 100% remotely - yay for accessibility! The downside was that it was harder to connect with other attendees. There was a whole world of social opportunities I missed out on, like in-person events, and there were people I barely talked to because they weren&#39;t engaged in the Virtual side of RC. It also kinda sucked to be in a timezone 5 hours ahead of the RC hub in New York. I often finished programming after 10pm, at which point my brain was wired for the night and I struggled to get to sleep. I definitely wasn&#39;t taking the best care of myself over those 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides my self-care taking a nosedive, there were other mental and emotional challenges. The fear of failure sometimes made my brain want to skive off and play chess, and then I&#39;d beat myself up about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🧠: You wanted to do this programming retreat and now here you are wasting your life playing chess! Maybe you&#39;re permanently broken and you&#39;ll never be productive ever again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Why are you so mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I think I was still burnt-out from my PhD, which I&#39;d just about wrapped up by the beginning of the batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BitTorrent client dragged on for almost the entire 12 weeks, when I originally expected it to be a quick &#34;warm-up&#34; project. I could&#39;ve picked up the same networking concepts by implementing a simpler protocol, and left more time for other topics. It also didn&#39;t lead to much interaction with other people because I was one of the few Recursers working on networking stuff. On the positive side, it did teach me lessons in persistence. There were moments where I despaired at the seemingly endless amount of work left to do, but by breaking it up into smaller tasks and chipping away at them every day, I eventually got to the finish line. I also figured out that it was important to let myself off the hook sometimes and work on Fun New Stuff. I could then return to the BitTorrent client feeling reinvigorated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could redo my batch, I&#39;d put more effort into scoping my projects, I&#39;d allow myself to drop projects if they weren&#39;t serving my interests, and I&#39;d join a study group (still feeling FOMO about the CryptoPals group). Also, I probably wouldn&#39;t read and write Zulip check-ins with such fanatical consistency. While it was helpful for feeling connected to my batchmates and led to some positive interactions, it took upwards of 30 minutes per day and I maybe could&#39;ve spent that time talking to people directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes struggled with the interpersonal side of things. Zulip is a useful tool (when it&#39;s not blasting you with unwanted notifications), but it&#39;s also a reminder of why I shy away from social media. I found myself checking on my daily check-ins to see who had reacted to them (🐙!). Whenever there was a lack of engagement, or whenever I compared myself to other Recursers who seemed to have made stronger connections, it made me feel envious or down on myself. It can also be tough to see the many awesome things that other people are doing when you&#39;re having a bad day. (The double-edged sword of Learning Generously). This is all embarrassing to admit, but I think it&#39;s better to be open in case there are other people who have felt the same way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RC is, at the end of the day, a recruiting service. However, it&#39;s completely optional to engage with this side of things, which I appreciate. I had my CV reviewed and got some jobhunting tips, but if anything I should&#39;ve made MORE use of their services. Despite this negligence on my part, the most life-impacting outcome of attending RC was that it netted me a job, quite by accident. I&#39;d been planning a career pivot into data science and machine learning, and was building up a &lt;a href=&#34;/dsml-portfolio.html&#34;&gt;portfolio&lt;/a&gt; to that end, but hadn&#39;t gotten any interiews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Amy (the only other Irish person attending RC during my batch) sent me a job posting that she thought would suit me. The job would involve designing and implementing programming languages. I immediately felt excited by this prospect - much more excited than by any of the data science jobs I&#39;d seen. Funnily enough, here&#39;s something I said in my very first daily update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling tempted by people talking about their programming language projects, makes me want to dive into the &lt;em&gt;Crafting Interpreters&lt;/em&gt; book, or maybe &lt;em&gt;Engineering a Compiler&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never did end up reading &lt;em&gt;Crafting Interpreters&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Engineering a Compiler&lt;/em&gt;, but I&#39;d made my own &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/ka&#34;&gt;tiny programming language before&lt;/a&gt;, which is probably what got me the job. I&#39;m now working on custom programming languages for a small Irish company called Manakau. I love working remotely (in my own timezone), my colleagues are really nice, and the programming is fun. Maybe I&#39;ll ask if I can write a blog post about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I loved my time at RC. The other day, I read over my daily updates for the first time since I&#39;d finished the batch, and it brought back a lot of fond memories. I do think I&#39;ve become a better programmer as a result of my time there, and being in that environment helped me to learn more about myself as a person, too. Not to mention that I got a job out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, it&#39;s time to close the book on my first ever batch at RC. I hope my batchmates are doing well, and I&#39;d be delighted to hear from them if they read this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;return Status.SUCCESS;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:return&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me an embarrassingly long time to realise that this is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_statement&#34;&gt;play on words&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:return&#34; title=&#34;Jump back to footnote 1 in the text&#34;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
