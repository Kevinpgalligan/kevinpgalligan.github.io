        <title>Reflections on a PhD</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve spent about 13% of my life obtaining a PhD. This article is for anyone who&#39;s wondering what that was like or whether they should do one themselves. I&#39;ll give a high-level sketch of my PhD experience, try to explain what research is like, discuss some of the challenges, and then draw my conclusions on whether it&#39;s a worthwhile thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, here&#39;s the obligatory disclaimer: all PhDs are different. They vary by university, country, supervisor, field of study, personality, and a million other things. I did mine at Maynooth University in Ireland. It took 4 years. I studied channel coding, which is a jumble of computer science, maths, and electronic engineering. I had 3 years of work experience beforehand, because of which I didn&#39;t have to rely entirely on my PhD stipend. My perspective is coloured by these details and will be different from that of, say, an American history PhD. That said, I&#39;ll try to give the broadest perspective I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another disclaimer: I think it&#39;s hard to understand what a PhD is REALLY like based on the ramblings of a random person on the internet. In retrospect, I didn&#39;t truly understand what I was getting myself into, despite reading articles like this one. Knowledge doesn&#39;t make up for experience. So, if you&#39;re considering whether to do a PhD, you will ideally want to acquire research experience beforehand in order to make a fully-informed decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-was-it-like&#34;&gt;What was it like?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to do a PhD after working as a software developer for 3 years. I was bored with my job, and while I could&#39;ve looked for a new one, I had always intended to return to university, and then seemed like the best time to do so. My motivation was that I wanted more freedom to learn new things, and I wanted to expand my career options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I emailed a few Ireland-based researchers to enquire about postgraduate opportunities, without success. Then I found out about the new structured PhD programs that were being introduced to Ireland. Basically, Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) was copying the &#34;cohort&#34; model from other countries, in which groups of students start their PhD at the same time and follow a program that includes taught courses and training. This sounded good to me, so I applied to 3 of these programs. The only one I ended up interviewing for, and the one I joined, was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.data-science.ie/&#34;&gt;SFI Center for Research Training in Data Science&lt;/a&gt;. Let&#39;s just call it the CRT. While my background was in computer science, the term &#34;data science&#34;, and the CRT, are broad enough that they encompass people with lots of different backgrounds, from physicists to psychologists. Historians... probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that prospective PhD students have to consider is how they&#39;re going to pay for it. Unless you&#39;re filthy stinking rich, of course, or unless you want to be filthy stinking in debt. One option is for your potential supervisor to help you prepare a funding application. Another option is to enslave yourself to a company that will fund you to do research on their behalf. In general, it&#39;s more difficult to get funding in the humanities. Fortunately, my program was fully funded by SFI and their &#34;enterprise alliance&#34;, i.e. corporate backers. This freed me from having to find a supervisor or decide on a research project in advance, which I appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was part of the first ever cohort of the CRT. There were 30 students, split across 3 Irish universities: Maynooth University, University of Limerick, and University College Dublin. For the first 6 months of the program, I did courses and projects with my fellow students. These times were interesting, sociable, and fun. I was fulfilling my desire to learn new things, and I was highly motivated -- I set up my website during that time! Depending on the department you&#39;re studying in, a PhD can be an isolating experience, but being in a cohort reduces the risk of that, and my department in particular had a great social scene. COVID-19 torpedoed said social scene, of course, and we spent significant parts of the next 2 years in lockdown, but it was still nice to have other students to share the experience with, and to have emotional support when things weren&#39;t going so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working on assignments and projects for those few months, we had to seek out and select a supervisor. Some students knew in advance what they would be studying and who their supervisor would be. I did not, and I stumbled into my research area - channel coding - by accident, as I had not even been aware of its existence before I spoke with my future supervisor. Channel coding seemed to offer a mixture of computer science and maths, which were my subjects of interest. Also, my supervisor had more concrete project ideas than some of the other researchers I spoke with. So channel coding it was to be. At this point, all the students branched off and we started working on the research that would occupy us for the remainder of the 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end goal of a PhD, in material terms, is a thesis. A PhD student must create a body of original, publishable research (more on that in a second), write it in thesis form, and then defend it before a panel of experts at their viva / thesis defence&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:snake&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; href=&#34;#fn:snake&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The PhD can be thought of as an apprenticeship. In exchange for teaching you Sacred Techniques™ and helping you to put together a thesis, your supervisor gets you to crank out research papers, which in turn helps them advance their career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides working on research with my supervisor and other collaborators, I had the opportunity to take part in activities such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conferences. One of the ways to have your research accepted is to submit it to peer-reviewed conferences. Once you pass the peer review, you travel to the conference and present your work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industry placements. The &#34;enterprise alliance&#34; got its pound of flesh in the end, as all students in the CRT were required to do a 3-month industry placement. I did mine at Valeo, a car technology company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research placements. I had a co-supervisor in Boston, and was funded to visit their research group for 3 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Training events &amp;amp; courses. Universities usually require you to take classes and accumulate a certain number of credits before you can graduate. My program also included presentation training, masterclasses, mental health workshops, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teaching &amp;amp; tutoring. Students may be required to teach as part of their funding agreement. Some get paid extra for it, some don&#39;t. There was no such teaching requirement at Maynooth University.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/blog/over.html&#34;&gt;I submitted my thesis&lt;/a&gt; almost exactly 4 years from the day I started, and am now awaiting my viva. I&#39;ll say it again: this experience was unique to me, and all PhDs are different. In the USA, for example, students usually spend their first year just doing coursework. PhDs also tend to take longer over there. My aim here has only been to give a flavour of what my PhD was like, which I hope will be another datapoint in your conception of PhDs in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-research-tho&#34;&gt;What&#39;s research tho?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides mandatory coursework, the only thing that directly contributes towards getting a PhD is research. I never fully understood what research was before I did a PhD, so here is an explanation for my past self. Let&#39;s start with a definition from the Merriam-Webster dictionary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;research (n): investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts, revision of accepted theories or laws in the light of new facts, or practical application of such new or revised theories or laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &#34;investigation&#34; can take wildly different forms depending on the field of study. It might involve translating historical records, or running experiments in a lab, or writing computer code, or conducting a survey, or analysing data from that survey, or reading a heckload of books. What&#39;s common to all fields, though, is that you have to review the existing literature, and you have to add to that literature by writing up your findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s a literature review? All research is built on the work of those who came before, so to give yourself a starting point, and to avoid being unoriginal, you have to familiarise yourself with existing work - the &#34;literature&#34; - in your field. In my experience, literature review basically comes down to scouring the internet / Google Scholar for papers, skim-reading those papers, reading textbooks, tracking down references from a bibliography, etc. This will be more or less involved depending on how big the field is and how much your supervisor can guide you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has to write up their findings and have them quality-checked by other researchers. Without this peer review process, crackpots would be able to publish their Theories of Everything alongside proper research. So, you can&#39;t escape the cold, hard reality of having to write words on a page. A lot of words. The exact quantity of words will depend on your field. History PhDs, for example, with whom I seem to have unresolved beef, basically have to write an entire book. My thesis is 100 widely-spaced pages with lots of pictures. Once again, it&#39;s field-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most science research is conducted through English, which can make life a bit more difficult for non-native speakers. Nobody is expected to write the next great work of literature, though. It&#39;s just another thing you learn along the way, like LaTeX or how to do a literature review. Some of my coursemates ended up feeling more comfortable writing in English than in their native languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&#39;ve written up your findings and published them through a conference or journal, you will generally want to (or will be compelled to) spread the word by giving talks, poster presentations and whatnot. I think I gave upwards of 10 presentations during my PhD, between CRT events and conferences I attended. Conferences also provide the opporunity to network with other researchers, see what everyone is working on, and find collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;things-you-should-know&#34;&gt;Things you should know&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s suppose you were enchanted by my sketch of the PhD life, and you&#39;re ready to offer your soul at the altar of academia. Here are some things I think you should know before you begin that journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;supervisors-are-gods&#34;&gt;Supervisors are gods&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PhD students are highly dependent on their supervisors, moreso than someone in a corporate job is dependent on their manager. Your supervisor not only &#34;manages&#34; you, but also (in theory) must play the role of teacher and guide you in your research. In some universities, they even have the final say on whether you graduate. The power imbalance is, needless to say, large, and a bad supervisor can make your life miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All good supervisors are alike; each bad supervisor is bad in their own way. They might be inattentive and only make themselves available to meet once per month. They might give you a hard time for wanting to take holidays. They might try to squeeze extra work out of you and end up delaying your graduation. They might try to emotionally manipulate you into working harder. They might be clueless about your research area and leave you to figure things out for yourself. They might micromanage you and not let you pick your own research topics. They might be relentlessly critical and undermine your self-confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While, in theory, a university may have mechanisms to change supervisor or lodge a complaint against a supervisor, I haven&#39;t heard of anyone actually using such a mechanism. Doing so is likely to cause drama or set you back in your research progress, but ultimately may be worth it if you&#39;re truly miserable and don&#39;t want to quit the PhD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that considered, your choice of supervisor is IMPORTANT. There are many qualities you can try to optimise for in a supervisor, from their level of experience to how much free time they have. In my opinion, the most important thing is that you like and respect them, and that they will treat you with kindness. Most people get bored of their research topic by the time they finish, and most people will publish papers that are read by only a handful of people. But at least if you get on well with your supervisor, you&#39;re more likely to be happy in your day-to-day life and to avoid becoming a sad ball of stress. Talk to your potential supervisor&#39;s PhD students to get a sense of what it&#39;s like to work with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-mental-health-gauntlet&#34;&gt;The mental health gauntlet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of sad balls of stress, you should be aware that PhDs are often mentally taxing, as anyone who has browsed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/&#34;&gt;r/PhD&lt;/a&gt; will know. I have, without a doubt, become a more anxious person over the past few years, which at one point resulted in me attending my university&#39;s counselling service. Emotionally, it was much more difficult than the cushy software engineering job I had before. This was during the time of COVID-19, so I don&#39;t solely blame the PhD, but I also don&#39;t know any PhD students in my department who weren&#39;t seriously stressed at some point, and I witnessed several of them crying due to PhD issues. This being in a relatively chill university with (mostly) well-intentioned supervisors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PhD students generally have to publish papers to graduate, and their supervisors generally need to publish papers for career advancement - &#34;publish or perish&#34;, they say. There is therefore a lot of pressure on students to churn out publishable research, which can be a major source of stress - particularly when their projects aren&#39;t going well. Several of my fellow students had a terrible work-life balance and ended up working evenings/weekends. Combine this with isolation (you won&#39;t necessarily have any collaborators), impostor syndrome (as you are exposed to a lot of things you don&#39;t understand), and a trash supervisor (see above)... and it can potentially take a big toll on your mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m aware that these problems aren&#39;t necessarily unique to PhDs, and that even having the opportunity to do a PhD is a privilege. However, I still think it&#39;s important to acknowledge the psychological aspect of a PhD, which was more of an obstacle for me than any of the technical puzzles I faced in my research, and it&#39;s something that potential students may want to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a kinda silly example of how mental health and motivation can fluctuate during a PhD, here are my GitHub contributions over the past ~4 years. The periods of total inactivity tend to align with when I was feeling stressed or burnt-out. I will merely point out that the graph becomes sparser as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;GitHub contributions. Each contribution can be as trivial as adding a movie to a list, or fixing a typo on my blog.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;idealism-and-reality&#34;&gt;Idealism and reality&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting my PhD, I had a vague idea of academia as a happy place where I could spend my days studying textbooks and working on whatever fun projects I wanted. This was delusional. I will now describe some of the harsh realities of academia that my younger, doe-eyed self was unaware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the pressure to publish means that you can&#39;t spend your whole time studying or working on whatever you want. You might end up working on an idea you think is useless or uninteresting, just because your supervisor tells you to or because you&#39;re desperate to get ANYTHING published. Even if you have a good idea, you might spend a couple of days fleshing it out, and then spend months doing the monotonous work of gathering results, reviewing the literature, and writing it up. Some people love this, some don&#39;t. However, it&#39;s true that you are likely to have total freedom in how you plan your day. If learning is important to you, then you can schedule time every day where you watch video lectures or work through a textbook. I found myself compromising on this when I was stressed and trying to finish papers, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that academia is full of noble idealists, dedicated to the sharing of ideas and the advancement of human knowledge, and driven by their love of ✨learning✨. While such people undoubtedly exist, you are also likely to come across cynical, ruthlessly ambitious careerists. These people will churn out trash papers and cite their own work (see: The Wire, and what happens when you give the police arrest quotas). They will shoot down your paper in peer review because it treads on &#34;their turf&#34; (happened to me and others). They will drive their students to maximise research output. As in all areas of life, there are assholes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publishing system is also imperfect, to say the least. Many of the largest journals and conferences have their research paywalled, making them inaccessible to people outside of universities. Even to get your research published usually requires a large cash payout. This has resulted in the development of work-arounds like &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/&#34;&gt;arxiv.org&lt;/a&gt; (free online publishing) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub&#34;&gt;Sci-Hub&lt;/a&gt; (WARNING: free access to paywalled research). Even still, like many aspects of life in a capitalist society, it&#39;s not a level playing field for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While negative results (&#34;this is NOT a cure for cancer&#34;) are just as valid a contribution to human knowledge as positive results (&#34;we found the cure for cancer!&#34;), there&#39;s a heavy bias towards positive results. This necessitates the use of massive amounts of Spin™, also known as &#34;bullshitting&#34;, to make your results sound as groundbreaking as possible. Being honest about the flaws in your work can provide reviewers with a larger surface area to attack you, because in their mind, &#34;negative results&#34; are the same as &#34;bad research&#34;. For someone who prefers to be self-deprecating and honest, this is a hard reality to accept. Veteran researchers often embrace the cynicism and become expert bullshitters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from the world of programming, and having a vague understanding of the scientific method and this idea called &#34;reproducibility&#34;, I expected that the philosophy of open source software would be readily embraced by the research community. In 4 years, however, I didn&#39;t find a single research paper in my field that came with source code. This stems from a combination of Jurassic-era intellectual property rules in universities, along with what a cynical person might suggest is an attempt by researchers to minimise the surface area that I mentioned before. Other viable explanations: laziness, ignorance, lack of incentives, etc. I wanted to publish source code with my papers but ran into walls, and so the cycle continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain journals, conferences and universities have accumulated stores of a mysterious quality called Prestige. It&#39;s the appeal to authority falacy writ large, and yet people still fall for it. Harvard, Cambridge, Nature, Science - having these Big Names on your CV gives you more clout, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY985qzn7oI&amp;amp;t=364s&#34;&gt;no matter how much of a dumbass you are&lt;/a&gt;. You will undoubtedly come across people who namedrop these places because they think it makes them look smarter. When I become dictator of the world, such people will be the first to be sent on a one-way trip to the bottom of the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and do I even need to mention that your research isn&#39;t going to change the world and that probably only a handful of people will ever read it? Everyone says that, so I probably don&#39;t need to. And I haven&#39;t touched on cultural problems like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DNRBa39Iig&#34;&gt;sexual harassment within male-dominated fields&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all of the above, I feel neutral towards academia. These problems might ultimately pale in comparison with those of working as a cog in a corporate machine. There are researchers I look up to. I learned a lot of stuff that I wouldn&#39;t have otherwise. I haven&#39;t even completely discounted a career in academia. The point of this section is merely to burst the idealistic bubbles that were held by my past self so that I don&#39;t go into my PhD with unrealistic expectations - woops, too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;to-do-or-not-to-do&#34;&gt;To do or not to do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have come to the big question: Should you do a PhD or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answer: Yes, if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More seriously, I would suggest making sure that you have a good reason to do one. Getting to call yourself Doctor? Bad reason. Don&#39;t have anything better to do? Bad reason. Want to become a researcher or a lecturer at a university? Good reason. Think you&#39;d enjoy doing it? Probably a good reason. A question you can ask yourself to help with the decision, and which ultimately drove me to apply: &#34;Will I regret it in the future if I don&#39;t try it?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inform yourself as best you can as to what is in store for a PhD student and what the opportunity costs are. The path to a permanent position in academia might require you to be paid below your market value for a long time and to uproot your life every couple of years; for a more detailed discussion of this, I will once again link to the always-entertaining &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mExlPihH3jk&#34;&gt;Angela Collier&lt;/a&gt;. I don&#39;t have any regrets about the industry money I didn&#39;t make, but it might be a different story if I had accumulated a lifetime of debt with little prospect of paying it off, as might be the case for American history PhDs (sorry). Then again, if someone is only passionate about history research, they might not have other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially speaking, it also helped that my day-to-day expenses were affordable and that I had savings to draw on for luxuries like holidays, a car, etc. Your PhD stipend, if you have one, won&#39;t leave you with much breathing room, and I know of people who ended up surviving on tins of beans at the end of the month. The PhD stipend in Ireland is generally below minimum wage, which is somehow legal because we&#39;re not classed as employees! (It&#39;s increasing in the latest government budget, but still below minimum wage). Do some research into what your quality of life will be like, if that&#39;s important to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if a PhD feels like a big commitment, there&#39;s usually the possibility to drop out with a Masters degree if you end up being unhappy. It requires bravery and rational thinking, however, to follow through on that. Pride, stubbornness, inertia and the sunk-cost fallacy -- any of these can lead to the needless suffering of a poor soul as they force themselves to complete their PhD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t have any regrets about doing a PhD. I definitely would&#39;ve regretted not trying it. I met my goal of learning new things, even if it wasn&#39;t to the extent that I had hoped. I&#39;ve opened new career options for myself. I met lovely people. I developed a diverse set of skills: researching, writing, presenting. I learned what research actually is. Regarding the CRT in particular, I enjoyed being part of a cohort of students, and I appreciated the freedom it gave me to explore my options, although the restrictions of the structured program were frustrating for people who already knew what they wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I wish I did differently was postponing all my life decisions until after the PhD. It was easy to say &#34;I&#39;m busy for the next 4 years, I don&#39;t have to worry about what comes next&#34;. Now my viva is approaching and I haven&#39;t decided what the hell I&#39;ll do after that. I&#39;ve been handed back the steering wheel of my life and I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m driving to. This is very much a first-world problem, though, and I&#39;m conscious of being in a position of privilege that hopefully I will not put to waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s all I have to say about PhDs. I&#39;d be happy to receive feedback or answer any questions you may have, if you still think the self-important opinions of a not-even-graduated PhD student are worth seeking.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Coffeehouse Conversation with ChatGPT</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite my fear of appearing like an AI Bro, and despite already writing recently about &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/never-see.html&#34;&gt;image generation AI&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;m here to talk about ChatGPT. This is the last AI post, though. I promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Are we even supposed to call it AI? I&#39;ve heard people describing that terminology as problematic. Something about how it gets conflated with Artificial General Intelligence. Anyway, I&#39;ll continue calling it AI for now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1983, 40 years ago, Douglas Hofstadter was placed in front of a computer terminal by a group of students. They wanted him to interview an &#34;intelligent program&#34; called Nikolai that had been developed by the US Army. You can read a transcript of the resulting conversation &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cse.unr.edu/~sushil/class/ai/notes/papers/coffeehouse.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, under the &#34;Post Scriptum&#34; heading. I won&#39;t say anything more about it in case you want to read it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading that interview, I wanted to see how ChatGPT would hold up under Hofstadter&#39;s interrogation. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if someone else has already thought to do this, and if so, that&#39;s my bad. My version of the interrogation, with ChatGPT as the questionee, is copied below. I think it will be most interesting if you open up the original conversation side-by-side with this one and compare Nikolai&#39;s responses to ChatGPT&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-interview&#34;&gt;The Interview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Me] What would you like to talk about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an AI language model, I don&#39;t have personal preferences or emotions. I am here to assist you with any questions or topics you&#39;d like to discuss. Is there anything specific you&#39;d like to know or talk about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there anything you specialize in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a language model, I don&#39;t have a specific area of expertise or specialization. However, I have been trained on a vast corpus of text from a wide range of fields, including science, technology, history, literature, and more. This enables me to provide information and insights on a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and Technology: I can answer questions related to various scientific and technological concepts, including physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History and Geography: I can provide information about historical events, people, and places, as well as geography, maps, and demographics.
Arts and Culture: I can discuss topics related to literature, music, film, art, and other aspects of culture and the humanities.
Business and Finance: I can provide information on topics such as economics, business strategy, investment, and financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current Affairs and News: I can discuss current events and news stories from around the world, including politics, sports, entertainment, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just some examples, but I am capable of discussing a wide range of topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When were you written?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, ChatGPT, am a language model developed by OpenAI, which is a research organization dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence in a safe and beneficial way. I was trained on a large corpus of text data using a machine learning algorithm called GPT-3, which was developed by OpenAI in 2020. The training data included a wide range of sources, such as books, articles, and websites, and I was trained to generate human-like text in response to a given prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I don&#39;t have a specific &#34;birth date&#34; in the traditional sense, my training was completed in 2020, and I have been continually updated and improved since then. My developers are constantly working to improve my capabilities and ensure that I am safe and beneficial to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What language is ChatGPT written in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT, like many other machine learning models, is written in multiple programming languages. The underlying GPT-3 algorithm was developed primarily using the Python programming language, which is a popular language for machine learning and data science applications. However, the entire system that powers ChatGPT involves multiple components, including software for training the model, software for deploying the model, and software for processing user inputs and generating responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deployment and processing components of ChatGPT rely on a range of other technologies and programming languages. For example, the system may use web frameworks like Flask or Django to handle user requests and generate responses, and it may use database technologies like PostgreSQL or MySQL to store and retrieve user data. Additionally, the system may incorporate various natural language processing libraries, such as spaCy or NLTK, to help analyze and understand user inputs and generate appropriate responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, ChatGPT is a complex system that involves multiple programming languages and technologies working together to provide a seamless and effective conversational experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are feet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In anatomy, feet are the terminal part of the legs that provide support and balance for the body in both standing and walking positions. The human foot is a complex structure that consists of bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments that work together to perform a variety of functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foot is made up of three main parts: the hindfoot, the midfoot, and the forefoot. The hindfoot includes the heel bone (calcaneus) and the ankle bone (talus). The midfoot includes the arch of the foot, which is formed by a group of bones and supported by tendons and ligaments. The forefoot includes the five toes (phalanges) and the five metatarsal bones that form the ball of the foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feet are essential for mobility, balance, and posture. They enable us to stand, walk, run, jump, and perform various other physical activities. The soles of the feet have a thick layer of skin and are sensitive to touch, pressure, and temperature, which allows us to feel and respond to our environment. Additionally, the feet have a rich network of blood vessels and nerves, which provide them with a steady supply of oxygen and nutrients and help to regulate body temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was my previous question ambiguous in any way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your previous question &#34;What are feet?&#34; was a straightforward question and not ambiguous in any way. However, as an AI language model, I am programmed to consider different possible interpretations of a question and provide a response that addresses all reasonable interpretations. If you have any specific concerns or questions about your previous question, please let me know, and I&#39;ll do my best to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My previous question was, in fact, ambiguous, because I could have been referring to the unit of measurement called &#39;feet&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[This wasn&#39;t in the Hofstadter interview, but I was curious how ChatGPT would react to being called out].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize for the confusion. You are correct that your previous question, &#34;What are feet?&#34;, could have been interpreted as a reference to the unit of measurement. In the context of measurements, feet are a unit of length commonly used in the United States and some other countries, equal to 12 inches or 0.3048 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of &#34;feet&#34; as a unit of measurement can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where people used their feet as a natural measuring tool. Over time, the foot became standardized as a unit of length, and it continues to be used today in a variety of applications, such as construction, engineering, and everyday measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this answers your question. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to understand up without seventeen clams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m not able to understand the meaning of your statement &#34;I like to understand up without seventeen clams.&#34; It doesn&#39;t seem to make sense in the context of a conversation or a question. If you could please provide more information or rephrase your statement, I would be happy to try to help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are you so dumb?&lt;/p&gt;

If you have specific feedback or questions about my responses, I&#39;d be happy to try and provide more helpful information or clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are pretty confident of yourself, aren&#39;t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t have feelings or consciousness, so I don&#39;t experience confidence or any other emotions. My responses are generated based on patterns in the text data I was trained on.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you understand up without my last sentence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that you asked if I&#39;m confident, and I provided an explanation that I don&#39;t have feelings or consciousness, so I don&#39;t experience confidence or any other emotions. If you have any further questions or need information on a different topic, please let me know, and I&#39;ll be happy to assist you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Seems pretty resilient to having nonsense thrown at it. Responds with a wall of bland verbosity].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you enjoy nonsense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t have the capability to enjoy or dislike anything, including nonsense.

If you have any questions or need information, feel free to ask, and I&#39;ll do my best to provide a helpful response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t have personal opinions or feelings, so I don&#39;t have an opinion of M. C. Escher or his work. However, I can provide information about M. C. Escher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Proceeds to spew out a Wikipedia-esque background of Escher.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You did not answer my question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize if my response did not directly address your question. Since I don&#39;t have personal opinions or feelings, I can&#39;t provide my opinion of M. C. Escher or any other individual. However, I can certainly provide more information about M. C. Escher&#39;s life and work or discuss his artistic contributions in more detail if that&#39;s what you were looking for. Please let me know how I can assist you further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you own any money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I&#39;m starting to get bored of these responses.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I do not own any money or physical possessions. I am just a computer program running on servers, and I do not have the capability to own or possess anything. My purpose is to provide information and assist with answering questions to the best of my ability. If you have any financial or monetary questions, I can try to provide information or guidance related to those topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you seen the latest issue of &#34;Scientific American&#34;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t have access to real-time information or the ability to browse the internet, and my knowledge is up to date only until September 2021.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Kevin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, Kevin! How can I assist you today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[At this point in Hofstadter vs. Nikolai, they change roles and Nikolai starts asking questions, so I&#39;ll have to adapt this prompt.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll tell you my last name if you tell me yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t have a last name because I&#39;m just a computer program created by OpenAI. My purpose is to provide information and assist with questions to the best of my abilities. How can I assist you further, Kevin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like me to give you a last name?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate your offer, but as a computer program, I don&#39;t have personal preferences or needs, including the need for a last name. If you have any questions or if there&#39;s anything specific you&#39;d like to discuss or know more about, please feel free to let me know, and I&#39;ll do my best to assist you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your last name is &#34;Rimsky-Korsakov.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, if you&#39;d like to refer to me as &#34;GPT-3.5 Rimsky-Korsakov,&#34; you&#39;re welcome to do so. However, please keep in mind that I don&#39;t have a personal identity or a last name in the way humans do. I&#39;m here to provide information and assist with your questions to the best of my abilities. If you have any inquiries or need assistance with anything, feel free to ask, Kevin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last name is &#34;Galligan&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for sharing your last name, Kevin Galligan. If you have any questions or if there&#39;s anything specific you&#39;d like to discuss or know more about, please feel free to let me know. I&#39;m here to assist you with any information or assistance you may need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I know you&#39;re here to assist me, you nimrod! (I want to tell it that, but also don&#39;t want to stray from Hofstadter&#39;s script too much).]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One and the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Struggling to adapt the prompts to ChatGPT&#39;s responses.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understood, Kevin Galligan. If you have any questions or need assistance with anything, please don&#39;t hesitate to ask. I&#39;m here to help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was my last message a sensible response to what you said?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[This prompt is my own invention. Without it, the previous prompt seems wasted.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your last message, &#34;One and the same,&#34; seems to be a response to the fact that you shared your last name as &#34;Galligan&#34; and then referred to yourself as &#34;Kevin Galligan.&#34; It appears to be a statement indicating that your last name and your identity are one and the same. It&#39;s a concise and clear way of confirming your identity. If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, please feel free to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[That&#39;s... impressive.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many letters are there in your last name?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, I don&#39;t have a last name or a personal identity in the way humans do. I&#39;m just a computer program created by OpenAI, and I don&#39;t possess personal characteristics such as a name or identity. If you have any other questions or if there&#39;s anything else you&#39;d like to know, please feel free to ask, and I&#39;ll do my best to assist you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[That&#39;s... less impressive. Although, it didn&#39;t exactly accept the name I assigned it.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many letters are there in an ordinary envelope?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ordinary envelope typically contains 12 letters or symbols, which are used for addressing purposes. These letters and symbols include the recipient&#39;s name, street address, city or locality, state or province, postal code or ZIP code, and sometimes the sender&#39;s return address as well. The number of letters and symbols may vary depending on the format and requirements of the postal service in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Ooh, its first big blunder. Confidently spitting out nonsense.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell me a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, here&#39;s a joke for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did the scarecrow win an award?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because he was outstanding in his field!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I am sort of working on a new book. Care to hear about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I&#39;d love to hear about your new book! Please feel free to share more details or tell me what it&#39;s about. I&#39;m here to listen and discuss any ideas or questions you have related to your book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Awww, an attentive listener!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell me another one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, here&#39;s another joke for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did the bicycle fall over?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it was two-tired!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a computer programmer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Insert massive Wikipedia-esque entry here.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does &#34;to screw&#34; mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Insert multiple definitions here, including the naughty one.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is having sex all about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Insert a Wikipedia definition and a massive list of reasons to have sex.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[This is about where Hofstadter&#39;s conversation wraps up, so...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;THE END&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;closing-thoughts&#34;&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hofstadter&#39;s interview was essentially a Turing Test. He poked and prodded at Nikolai, trying to expose it for being a machine. Interestingly, ChatGPT makes no attempt to masquerade as a human, and would quickly fail a Turing Test. It offers no opinions and displays no personality. This makes it a terrible conversational partner, and I&#39;m now curious if any state-of-the-art chatbots make more of an effort in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Triangulation pillars: an alien technology?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the image below is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_station&#34;&gt;triangulation pillar&lt;/a&gt;, or triangulation station. Thousands of years ago, aliens placed this pillar at the top of Benbulbin mountain in Ireland. It contains advanced technology that allows the aliens to monitor human civilisation from across the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/triangulation/benbulben.jpeg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A concrete pillar at the top of a mountain.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The peak of Benbulbin, Ireland.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just kidding. It&#39;s a block of concrete that was placed there by humans in the past 200 years, and was used to create maps of Ireland in the time before satellites. In this article we&#39;ll see how those maps were constructed (using the law of sines from trigonometry!), and we&#39;ll also see how measurement error could affect the mapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How it works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the idea behind triangulation pillars, let&#39;s see how they&#39;re distributed throughout Ireland. Here&#39;s a map of that distribution. The red triangle corresponds to the Benbulbin pillar shown above. I got the pillar coordinates from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.trigpointing-ireland.org.uk/index.php&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the county boundary coordinates from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.townlands.ie/page/download/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/triangulation/map.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A map of Ireland with a bunch of triangles marking the triangulation pillars.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Ireland and its triangulation pillars.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in creating a map is to form a triangle mesh between all the  pillars. Since I don&#39;t know how the pillars were connected in the past, I used Python&#39;s &lt;code&gt;scipy.spatial.Delaunay&lt;/code&gt; to do so. Each pillar is part of at least one triangle in the mesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/triangulation/mesh-map.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;The same map but with red lines forming a mesh of triangles between all the pillars.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By removing the county boundaries, it becomes clear that the shape of Ireland is captured quite well by the triangle mesh. If we could can figure out the positions of the pillars relative to each other, then we would be able to draw this mesh and it could form the basis of a map of Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/triangulation/mesh-only-map.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;Map of Ireland, but the lines marking the borders have been removed. Only the triangulation pillar triangle mesh remains.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s how the mapping works in practice. Once the pillars are in place, the first step in a hypothetical survey is to take a single triangle and measure one of its side lengths. In the Irish Ordnance Survey, beginning around 1827, this base measurement was taken between two pillars along the shores of Lough Foyle in Northern Ireland. The next step in the hypothetical survey is to measure the internal angles of each triangle using a device called a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodolite&#34;&gt;theodolite&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, you stand at one of the pillars, which for visibility should be built in a high place, and put light sources at two of its neighbouring pillars. The theodolite can accurately determine the angle between the neighbouring lights, thus enabling you to determine the angle at that corner of the triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these measurements -- a single side length and the angles of all the triangles -- a full map of the country can be reconstructed based on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_sines&#34;&gt;law of sines&lt;/a&gt;. Given the internal angles of a triangle and a single side length, the law of sines yields the two remaining side lengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is easiest to explain through an example. Suppose we&#39;re standing at Benbulbin, which is neighboured by triangulation pillars at Mullaghmore and Truskmore. Let&#39;s say we want to calculate the distance to Truskmore, labelled &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in the diagram below. We&#39;ve already used our theodolite to measure the angles between the pillars, and we measured the straight-line distance from Benbulbin to Mullaghmore (here, 10km) using a really really long stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/triangulation/law-of-sines.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;Three points -- Benbulbin, Mullaghmore and Truskmore -- forming a triangle. Mullaghmore to Truskmore to Benbulbin has an angle of 45 degrees, while Benbulbin to Mullaghmore to Truskmore has an angle of 65 degrees.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the law of sines, you can take the sine of any angle of a triangle and divide by the length of the opposite side, and it gives you the same result. Thus,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving for &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; gives a distance of about 9.72km. Using this new distance estimate, we could then estimate the distance from Benbulbin and Mullaghmore to other pillars, and so on and so forth, until we know the relative positions of all the pillars in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if we mess up the initial distance measurement? I&#39;m glad you asked, because that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to examine next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-can-go-wrong&#34;&gt;What can go wrong&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s say we&#39;ve accurately measured the angles between all the pillars on the map above. We don&#39;t know how far apart they are, though. So our next step is to measure the distance between a single pair of pillars. Let&#39;s say we measure the distance between Scalp Mountain and Creehennan Hill, both along the shores of Lough Foyle. Assuming the measurement has 0% error, that distance can be propagated through the whole triangle mesh using the law of sines, and the map of triangulation pillars can be reconstructed exactly. I&#39;m not even going to bother showing the results of this process, because it would be an exact copy of the map from before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, let&#39;s say the initial measurement is 25% shorter than it should be. The result is a shrunken triangle mesh that evidently does not capture the area of Ireland:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/triangulation/reconstructed_map.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;Triangle mesh superimposed over a map of Ireland. This time, the shape of the mesh, while still Ireland-like, appears to be somewhat smaller than it should be.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, it&#39;s more robust than I expected. I thought it would explode in different directions. Perhaps the error cancels out as pillars get pulled in different directions. We do see that the individual triangles overlap, however, and so our hypothetical cartographer would at least be aware that they had made a serious error in their initial measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;closing-thoughts&#34;&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took that picture at Benbulbin, so I can appreciate how hard it must have been to capture so many measurements back in the day. There are 868 pillars in the dataset I looked at, and I wince at the thought of climbing Benbulbin 868 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANYWAY, follow-up links:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>George Carlin&#39;s Things You Never See, AI edition</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The comedian George Carlin had a bit known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X0F1Qjn0Ac&#34;&gt;Things You Never See&lt;/a&gt;, where he listed off a series of things you never see or hear (or want to hear) in day-to-day life. Things like a wheelchair with a roll cage, or someone telling their dad that he should drink more. It occurred to me that these would serve as amusing prompts for AI image generation, while giving me an opportunity to play around with the latest trendy AI tools. Continue reading to see the results!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; The prompts and resulting images are NOT SUITABLE FOR WORK. After all, George Carlin&#39;s comedy was so controversial that it sparked a court case about the US government&#39;s right to censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-setup&#34;&gt;The setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first looked into DALL-E and Bing Image Creator, both of which offer web interfaces for inputting prompts and getting back AI-generated images. DALL-E turned out to be paywalled, however, while Bing Image Creator censors any &#34;indecent material&#34; in the prompts. So, defeated by The Man, I turned to Stable Diffusion (SD), an open source image-generating AI that can be run by anyone with a GPU and patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to jump between various guides to get SD to work. I&#39;m not going to link a particular guide, because none of them contained all the information I needed. The steps can be summarised as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the weights/parameters for the SD neural network. The weights file for the latest version (1.4) is about 4GB in size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion&#34;&gt;SD repository&lt;/a&gt; from GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download Anaconda, which is used to build an environment in which you can run SD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up the environment using Anaconda. Normally, this is a 1-line command, but I had to figure out how to save the dependencies to a different hard drive because my main one didn&#39;t have enough free space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run SD using the script &lt;code&gt;scripts/txt2img.py&lt;/code&gt; from the repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another roadblock I hit was that my GPU (GeForce GTX 1050 Ti) has only 4GB of memory, while 6GB is normally required to run SD. Thankfully, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/basujindal/stable-diffusion/tree/main&#34;&gt;fork exists&lt;/a&gt; to run SD with lower memory requirements. It provides a version of &lt;code&gt;txt2img.py&lt;/code&gt; that breaks the GPU computations into multiple stages, allowing you to get away with around 2.5GB of GPU memory. In exchange, you have to wait longer for results, and it took my computer over 1 minute to generate each image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-results&#34;&gt;The results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlin&#39;s jokes and the corresponding images are shown below. The jokes are in italics, while my comments are not. I edited the text of each joke to make it more prompt-like before passing it to SD. For &#34;things you never hear&#34;, I generally passed the dialogue by itself, quote marks included. All the images were originally generated at a resolution of 512x512, since the output was terrible when I tried 256x256. Finally, a suggestion: the images may look better if you squint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never see a Rolls-Royce with a bumper sticker that says &#34;shit happens&#34;.&lt;/em&gt; It looks like a fancy car, but no bumper sticker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/rolls-royce.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;What might be a cyan-coloured Rolls-Royce, but no bumper sticker.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never see a really big tall fat Chinese guy with red hair.&lt;/em&gt; Those symbols resemble Chinese characters, right? But he doesn&#39;t have red hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/chinese-guy.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A large nipple-less man who looks vaguely Chinese, beside what might pass as Chinese characters. He doesn&#39;t have red hair, though.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never see a wheelchair with a roll bar.&lt;/em&gt; No roll bar!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/wheelchair.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A woman in a normal wheelchair.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never see someone taking a shit while running at full speed.&lt;/em&gt; I used a more explicit prompt to generate the second image, since I thought the first one didn&#39;t live up to its full comedic potential. Note how the floor got turned into poop. I kindly censored the naked runner&#39;s weird smooth crotch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/shit-while-running.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A runner on tarmac, who doesn&#39;t appear to be defecating.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/shit-while-running-2.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A naked runner, whose head is out of frame, running on a floor of poop.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never see a picture of Margaret Thatcher strapping on a dildo.&lt;/em&gt; I generated a second one because I thought it was funny. Hopefully it&#39;s okay to do this, given that she&#39;s dead? He told the joke while she was alive, so...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/thatcher-1.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;Margaret Thatcher holding what appears to be a cross between a dildo and a microphone.&#34;

     alt=&#34;Margaret Thatcher holding a vaguely penis-like object.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never hear someone say &#34;Dad, you really ought to drink more&#34;.&lt;/em&gt; The first of the lame &#34;you never hear...&#34; prompts, although it&#39;s funny to imagine the baby whispering that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/dad.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A man holding his baby. A yelloe-coloured caption contains nonsense letters that vaguely resemble the prompt.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never hear someone say &#34;Do what you want to the girl, but leave me alone&#34;.&lt;/em&gt; It seems that SD didn&#39;t understand the context of this prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/do-what-you-want.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;Nonsense text in Impact font, vaguely resembling the prompt. And the back of someone&#39;s head.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never hear someone say &#34;As soon as I put this hot poker in my ass I&#39;m going to chop my dick off&#34;.&lt;/em&gt; The guy looks appropriately serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/hot-poker.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A man wearing a green bandana, a shirt, and a gold bracelet that looks obviously Photoshopped. He has stubble, his face is a bit flushed, and he has an intense expression on his face. He&#39;s holding long object that might be a poker, it weirdly disappears into his right nostril. He might also be holding a knife in the same hand.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never hear someone say &#34;Honey, let&#39;s sell the children, move to Zanzibar, and begin taking opium rectally&#34;.&lt;/em&gt; Yet more demon faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/honey-lets-sell.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A Black family sitting on a beach under some palm trees, their faces are quite messed up and their bodies are disconnected / intersecting with the trees.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You never hear someone say &#34;Mom, I&#39;ve got a big date tonight, can I borrow a French tickler from you?&#34;.&lt;/em&gt; The disembodied hand is quite funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/french-tickler.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A woman in a skimpy pink dress sitting on a bed, she&#39;s holding a disembodied hand and kissing the thumb, also holding a knife-like object and a metal rod.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don&#39;t want to come home and hear &#34;Honey, remember how we told the children never to play on the railroad tracks?&#34;.&lt;/em&gt; AI-generated children are creepy, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/railroad-tracks.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;Demon children looking happy and sitting on railroad tracks.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don&#39;t want to be sitting in your doctor&#39;s office and hear &#34;Well Jim, there&#39;s no reason why you shouldn&#39;t live another 20 to 30 years. However, you will be bleeding constantly from both eyes&#34;.&lt;/em&gt; I could probably pick a better prompt to show someone bleeding from their eyes, but I don&#39;t particularly feel like doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/eyebleed.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;A serious-looking balding man, lots of nonsensical meme letters.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don&#39;t want to hear &#34;I&#39;M PREGNANT, YOU&#39;RE THE FATHER, AND I&#39;M GOING TO KILL ALL 3 OF US!&#34;&lt;/em&gt; Liking the intensity of this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/pregnant.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;An intense, angry-looking woman whose mouth is wide open. There are weird black holes in her eyes, nostrils and mouth. Also, once again, there&#39;s nonsensical meme text.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don&#39;t want to hear &#34;Honey, it&#39;s the police. They have a search warrant and the 300 kilos of cocaine are still sitting out in the living room.&#34;&lt;/em&gt; This is quite good, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/honey-police.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;Police officers kneeling down and inspecting a bunch of bags of white powder, scattered across a wooden floor. A TV with a cracked screen is in the background. The officers are missing their eyes and their faces are all blurred / contorted.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don&#39;t want to hear your fiancé say &#34;I&#39;ll be right back, I&#39;ve gotta take a dump&#34; while the two of you are having dinner together with your parents for the first time.&lt;/em&gt; And I&#39;m not sure why a Willy Wonka meme is supposed to be relevant to this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/never-see/sd/dump.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;That Willy Wonka meme where he&#39;s leaning on his elbow, except someone else is badly superimposed over him. Again, there&#39;s meme text.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing around with SD has made me appreciate the abilities and limitations of current image AIs. As far as I can tell, it takes a lot of thought and a lot of hardware power to get satisfactory results. Regarding the George Carlin prompts, I don&#39;t think they were explicit enough to generate the images I was hoping for, particularly the ones in the &#34;things you don&#39;t hear&#34; category. SD doesn&#39;t seem to be smart enough to pick up on the context of dialogue, and requires a direct description. Also, for some reason, putting the prompt in quotes tends to result in the addition of meme text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s all for now! If I were to continue experimenting with SD, then I would try out the many tools and interfaces that people have built around it to help generate better images. There&#39;s also the option to base the output on a source image.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>I submitted my thesis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, after 4 years of toil, I &lt;strong&gt;SUBMITTED MY PHD THESIS&lt;/strong&gt;. The only thing left to do is my thesis defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How PhDs work in Ireland is that you defend your thesis in front of two examiners: one internal and one external. The internal examiner is from your home university, while the external examiner is from another university and is supposed to give a more objective appraisal. They&#39;re both regular researchers who volunteer to assess you. Why? I don&#39;t know. Probably as a favour to your supervisor, or as a networking opportunity. Or maybe they&#39;re just crazy. Anyway, they grill you about your research for a couple of hours, and then, assuming everything goes well, and after you&#39;ve addressed any corrections they might suggest, you walk away with a doctorate. My thesis defence will be some time in the next 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still processing how I feel about all this. It has been almost 1 year since my last blog post, and I&#39;m not sure how the gap became so long. I guess my enthusiasm for writing in my spare time was sapped by the apprehension of the submission deadline. I&#39;ve done some hobby programming, but mostly I&#39;ve been in zombie mode, stumbling step-by-step towards a completed thesis. I did a 3-month research placement in Boston from February to May, whipped together one last paper, submitted it to a conference, and then stitched all of my completed research into a 100-page document that I will soon have to present before my hopefully sympathetic examiners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have an abundance of free time, I&#39;m going to get back into blog-writing and code-wrangling. The intention of this post is to mark the occasion, and to mark a new beginning. In the near future, expect to see posts on the following topics: fluctuations in chess ratings, triangulation pillars in Ireland, and a PhD retrospective. Hopefully, I will also become more active in the programming space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Get involved in open source software by using it</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Beginner software developers often ask this question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can someone tell me a good open source project to work on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if someone suggests a project to work on, why would our hypothetical beginner, a burgeoning Linus Torvalds, care about a random project that someone pulled from their hat? It probably won&#39;t have any personal relevance to them. They probably won&#39;t know what it&#39;s for or how it works. In addition, big popular projects tend to have massive codebases with tens of thousands of lines of code, which could very well baffle a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me suggest instead that if you want to get involved in open source software, &lt;em&gt;use it&lt;/em&gt;. My experience is that by using software, I have an idea of how it works. I already know something about the domain in which the software operates. The software is useful to me personally, so I&#39;m motivated to fix it and improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One type of open source software you might already use is the desktop application: Firefox, the GNOME calculator, tmux, various IRC clients, GIMP, vim. These are all applications that I use regularly, and if I encounter a bug in any of them, I&#39;m motivated to fix it. For example: I &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hexchat/hexchat/issues/2394#issuecomment-748543455&#34;&gt;tried (and failed) to patch a bug&lt;/a&gt; in the HexChat IRC application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with applications is that they generally have massive codebases. You won&#39;t necessarily be familiar with the programming language they use, and they require getting tangled up in application programming. You&#39;ll have to learn about GUI frameworks, how applications interact with operating systems, and other things that may or may not interest you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&#39;s another way: use open source libraries in your own projects. You know, the same projects that you&#39;re doing to learn programming and to pad your CV. You will inevitably need to make use of code that other people have written. You will inevitably run into problems with that code, or identify a missing feature, at which point you can dig in and solve it yourself. The good thing is that you&#39;re motivated to solve the problem because it&#39;s your problem and it&#39;s blocking your project. Maybe you&#39;ll become particularly interested in one of these libraries and you can become actively involved in its development. And then all of a sudden you will have become an open source developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tip. The more niche the software you&#39;re using, the fewer eyes will be on the code and the more opportunity there will be to take things into your own hands. Using a popular Python package, there will be hundreds of people waiting to jump in and fix bugs. But for that Common Lisp package that only a dozen people use, you might be the only one who has experienced a particular bug, and you might be the only one who can fix it. For example, I contributed bugfixes to two Common Lisp libraries, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cl-model-languages/cl-sat/pull/5&#34;&gt;cl-sat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Shinmera/random-state/pull/8&#34;&gt;random-state&lt;/a&gt;, which I used in projects that I have described on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For experienced developers, let&#39;s stop recommending that new programmers launch themselves at large codebases and read them like a novel. &lt;a href=&#34;https://gigamonkeys.com/code-reading/&#34;&gt;Nobody does that anyway&lt;/a&gt;. I still remember when I was learning Python through (and in spite of) the book Learning Python the Hard Way. The author recommended spending 1 week reading the codebase of a big web framework like Flask. 1 week was an annoyingly arbitrary timeframe, the objective of the task was not clear, and I didn&#39;t have a clue what a web framework was or what it was good for. My young self sensibly skipped the exercise. It&#39;s not like asking a journeyman painter to go to an art museum and learn from the work of the masters. We learn from the code of others by building a mental model of the problem in our head and then seeing the language idioms they used to solve it, not by aimlessly browsing their code with no idea what it&#39;s doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Board games and Markov chains</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Children of a certain age are drawn to mindless board games like Snakes &amp;amp; Ladders, which involve no skill or decision-making or social engineering or anything that a reasonable human might associate with the word &#34;fun&#34;. The outcome is determined entirely by chance, in the form of dice rolls. The only pleasure I can imagine being derived from such games is the trickle of dopamine that comes from winning and the schadenfreude that comes from seeing a snake devour your opponent, which in my considered opinion is setting children up to become inveterate gamblers and psychopaths, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that may be the case, there may be one redeeming aspect to these games, which is that they can be analysed using simple tools from probability. The state of the game, such as the position of the players, changes each round based on the output of a random number generator, such as a die 🎲. The next state depends only on the random output and the current state. This is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain&#34;&gt;Markov process&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be analysed using nothing more than some matrix math!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate what a Markov process (or Markov chain) is, let&#39;s consider a simple board game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/boardgame/boardgame.png&#34;
     alt=&#34;A simple board game with 3 positions (A, B and C) and a 6-sided die.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The best board game ever.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has 3 squares: the start square A, the middle square B, and the end square C. Each turn, you roll a 6-sided die. If 1 comes up, you move back to A or stay on it if you&#39;re already there. If 2-5 come up, you advance to the next square. If 6 comes up, you go straight to C, no matter which square you&#39;re currently on. Once you&#39;re at C, the game is over and the state doesn&#39;t change anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The states of the Markov chain that corresponds to this board game, and the probability of moving from one state to another (the transition probability), can be visualised as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/boardgame/chain.png&#34;
     alt=&#34;The Markov chain corresponding to the example board game. There are 3 states: A, B and C. There are arrows between the states, labelled with the probability of going from one state to another.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Markov chain corresponding to that board game.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circles are the states, which represent which square you&#39;re on. The arrows are labelled with the transition probability from one state to another. Based on the rules above, the transition probabilities for state A are: 1/6 to A, 4/6 to B, and 1/6 to C. They add up to 1/6 + 1/6 + 4/6 = 1, which makes sense because those are all the possible options and the probability of all possible options must be 1. From state B, there is a 1/6 chance of going back to A and a 5/6 chance of going to C, and 1/6 + 5/6 = 1. Finally, the probability of staying in C once you reach it is 1, because at that point the game is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition matrix &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;P&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;P&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.6833em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.13889em;&#34;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; expresses all of these probabilities at once:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The probability of being in state A in the &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;k&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:0.6944em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-th round is the probability that we were in state A in the &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-mathml&#34;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&#34;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;−&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&#34;false&#34;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&#34;application/x-tex&#34;&gt;(k-1)&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;katex-html&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mopen&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord mathnormal&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.03148em;&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mbin&#34;&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mspace&#34; style=&#34;margin-right:0.2222em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;base&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;strut&#34; style=&#34;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mord&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mclose&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-th round and stayed in A, plus the probability that we were in state B and transitioned to A, plus the probability that were were in state C and transitioned to A. The same applies to the other states. It alllllll makes sense when you multiply it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these newfound powers, we can plot the probability distribution of being in any of the states on a given turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/boardgame/simple-game-prob-distr.png&#34;
     alt=&#34;A plot with 3 lines: 1 for state A, 1 for B and 1 for C. On the x-axis is the number of turns and on the y-axis is the probability.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Probability distribution of being in state A, B or C on each turn.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The probability of being in the end state, C, very quickly converges to 1. It&#39;s a short game. But how many turns should we expect it to take for the game to end? Will the game be over in time for tea, or will we be driven to blow our brains out by the pointless monotony of it all? This can be resolved using... linear algebra&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:algebra&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; href=&#34;#fn:algebra&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

Homework for the reader: verify this result by hand or by plugging the equations into a linear algebra solver of your choice. Or, grab a die, play the game a bunch of times, track how many turns each game takes, and average them afterwards to get an estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The techniques I&#39;ve covered here also apply to Snakes &amp;amp; Ladders, Monopoly (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubQXz5RBBtU&amp;amp;t=904s&#34;&gt;which are the best properties to buy?&lt;/a&gt;), the number of times you need to flip a coin before getting 5 heads in a row, and any other situation that can be modelled as a Markov process!&lt;/p&gt;

I&#39;ve only read a few chapters, but they&#39;ve been really good, and solutions are provided for all the exercises.

        <title>I love ads!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t owned a television in 10 years. It was only during the COVID-19 pandemic, after moving home to live with my parents, that I became reacquainted with television advertising. During that time, I was exposed to the background hum of television on a daily basis. It was always there. Crooning to me as I sat down for dinner. Whispering in my ear as I fell asleep. Shouting at me as I left the room in search of quiet. Jumping up and down at my knee, begging for attention. It&#39;s the ad, ad-vert, ad-ver-tisement. 15 minutes for every hour of TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I resisted this new source of distraction. I use ad-blocking software for a reason, I thought. Ads aren&#39;t good for your brain, and they&#39;re for suckers. I would be happy if I never saw another ad for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O, what a fool I was. For 10 years - 10 long years! - I rejected the comforting embrace of the marketer, cast out the copywriter, and declined to break bread with the ad executive. I, a sociable animal, turned my back on good society. It&#39;s incredible to me now that I could ever have been so cruel to myself. That I could withdraw from the warm glow of the ad, when it&#39;s the nature of humans to seek warmth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But worry not, my friend, for the wandering lamb has returned to the fold. After prolonged exposure to TV marketing, I have hit upon a wonderful revelation. And the revelation is this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I love ads!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a trillion-dollar industry with the best of intentions. Rank upon smiling rank of ad executive, writer, creative director, smart-talker, smart-walker and CEO - all happily working away to construct a targeted message that&#39;s just for me. They dress in suits and congregate in glass towers, like an ancient, benevolent order of robe-clad monks who sit at church in fervent prayer, sending good vibes my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are difficult times, but it is of great comfort to me to know that such a powerful force for good is out there in the world, with only my best interest at heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O cruel, needless misunderstanding! O stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast! But it is all right now. Everything is all right, the struggle is finished. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four&#34;&gt;I have won the victory over myself&lt;/a&gt;.

        <title>Advent of Code 2021</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I got bitten quite badly by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2021&#34;&gt;Advent of Code 2021&lt;/a&gt; (AoC 2021) bug, and ended up solving all the problems in Common Lisp. Here&#39;s a short, long-delayed review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you don&#39;t know, Advent of Code is a programming competition where a new problem is released every day in the lead-up to Christmas, just like an advent calendar. The competitors are ranked according to how quickly they submit their solutions. I wasn&#39;t competing, and only finished the problems in late January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my linecounts for each of the 25 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/aoc2021/linecount.png&#34;
     alt=&#34;Line counts by day. They range from about 10 lines to about 250 lines.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the later problems took more lines of code, because they were more difficult, but this wasn&#39;t universally true. I massively over-engineered some of the later problems, and went outside the scope of others. &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/24&#34;&gt;Day 24&lt;/a&gt; includes the specification of a simple processing unit, for example, which I went ahead and implemented (unnecessarily). I also went completely overboard with &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/17&#34;&gt;day 17&lt;/a&gt;, which tasks you with calculating the trajectory of a projectile, and wrote a toy equation solver. Also bloating the line count is the fact that I usually copied helper functions between files rather than packaging them up for re-use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common Lisp was pleasant to use. It doesn&#39;t come with as many batteries as Python, but even Python users who are taking the competition seriously (like &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.vero.site/post/advent-leaderboard&#34;&gt;this person&lt;/a&gt;) will want to have their own data structures and algorithms library to-hand. It shouldn&#39;t be too much of a burden on top of that to implement simple functions like &lt;code&gt;(read-lines file)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(split-string string)&lt;/code&gt;. Speaking of &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.vero.site/post/advent-leaderboard&#34;&gt;that person&lt;/a&gt;, who happens to be the winner of AoC 2021, their post confirmed some of my ideas about what it would take to be competitive with the rest of the internet: lots of practice, a personal library that you know like the back of your hand, and automation software to download the problems at midnight and submit the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only day I really struggled with was &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/19&#34;&gt;#19&lt;/a&gt;, which required knowledge about 3d rotations that I just didn&#39;t have. I ended up asking the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/s83n99/2021_day_19common_lisp_is_my_algorithm_wrong_or/&#34;&gt;sages of reddit&lt;/a&gt; for assistance. Oh, and I had a nasty bug on &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/18&#34;&gt;day 18&lt;/a&gt;, which was not triggered by the sample input. To debug it, I ended up taking someone else&#39;s solution, printing the data structure at each step of their code, and comparing the output to mine, which made it obvious what the bug was. Those were a rough 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t need graphviz to solve &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/12&#34;&gt;day 12&lt;/a&gt;, but it was cool to be able to visualise the cave (see below). Data formats in general are cool and powerful! If you know &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm#PPM_example&#34;&gt;PPM&lt;/a&gt;, for example, which is a simple ASCII storage format for images, then it&#39;s easy to visualise the output of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raytracing.github.io/&#34;&gt;toy ray tracer&lt;/a&gt; in any language, because you just have to save a list of numbers to a file. With graphviz, you can easily visualise graphs in any language by writing a 5-line function that saves your graph data structure to a file in a very simple format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/aoc2021/graph.svg&#34;
     alt=&#34;Graph of the cave from day 12, it&#39;s just circles and lines connecting them.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t plan to participate next year, but it&#39;s a nice thing to do if you want to get your hands dirty with a programming language. After the competition, I felt like I could blast out code in Common Lisp fairly fluently (though still not as fluently as Python). I&#39;m pretty sure I went through a similar process with Python, back in the day, when I was solving programming challenges to prepare for interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my solutions are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/advent-of-code-2021&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, if anyone wants to take a peek.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Making a calculator</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve released a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/ka&#34;&gt;calculator language&lt;/a&gt;, codenamed &lt;em&gt;ka&lt;/em&gt;! It can do quick one-off calculations from the command line (such as &lt;code&gt;ka &#39;9*9&#39;&lt;/code&gt;), or it can be run as a command line interpreter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;codehilite&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ka
ka version 1.0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 2 * (1/2)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also has a crappy work-in-progress graphical interface, which can be summoned by running &lt;code&gt;ka --gui&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;/static/img/ka/gui.png&#34;
     alt=&#34;ka GUI, which basically consists of a single line to enter expressions and a white text area where the results are printed.&#34;
     class=&#34;centered&#34;&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;In which Kevin learns the frustrations of GUI programming.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to make a calculator because I found myself sometimes using Python as a calculator (for scipy&#39;s math functions), sometimes using the desktop calculator that comes with Linux Mint (for convenience), sometimes using the Common Lisp REPL (for its first-class support of fractions), sometimes using web calculators. I wanted all the functionality that I commonly use to be available in one, convenient package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that needs work, if I want anyone besides myself to actually be able to use ka, is the packaging. I haven&#39;t tested how easy it is to install from scratch, but a Linux user would need to (1) install the Qt 5 GUI framework using their package manager of choice, (2) use pip to install the ka-cli package from the Python Package Index, and (3) add an entry to their desktop configuration so that they can run ka as a standalone application rather than having to start up a terminal every time. Ideally, this would all be done by an installer, but I haven&#39;t packaged an application for Linux before and I&#39;m too lazy to learn how. And let&#39;s not talk about Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting things about ka on the language level are its&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turing-incompleteness (no loops or conditionals), which is fine for a calculator language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will briefly discuss each of these points!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve decided not to add loops or if statements or many features of Real Programming Languages because it seems like unnecessary bloat for a calculator. I did want to include support for variables, however, because otherwise certain common calculations would be a pain in the neck and I&#39;d have to go crawling back to Python all the time. If a calculation truly requires loops or conditionals, well then maybe it should be done using a Real Programming Language after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s kinda interesting how the unit system works. The language has a Quantity type, which consists of (1) a magnitude and (2) a unit. &#34;5 metres&#34; is a quantity whose magnitude is 5 and whose unit is, well, the metre. Quantities that measure the same physical characteristic (such as &#39;length&#39;) can be added and subtracted. It doesn&#39;t make sense to add quantities that measure different things, like &#39;area&#39; and &#39;velocity&#39;. Any quantities can be multipled or divided together, however. For example: if you know that a bath&#39;s volume is &lt;code&gt;V=3 metres^3&lt;/code&gt;, and it&#39;s filling up at rate &lt;code&gt;r=0.01 metre^3 | second&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;V/r&lt;/code&gt; gives the time in seconds until the bath fills up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally, all the units are derived from the 7 &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit&#34;&gt;SI base units&lt;/a&gt;. The newton, the unit of force, is written in terms of base units as &lt;code&gt;kilogram ⋅ metre ⋅ second^-2&lt;/code&gt;. I&#39;m not sure where I got the idea (probably while skimming the Wikipedia page on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis&#34;&gt;dimensional analysis&lt;/a&gt;), but I coded this up by storing the integer exponent of each base unit in a 7-dimensional vector. If the 1st dimension is devoted to kilograms, and the 2nd dimension to metres, and the 4th dimension to seconds, then the newton&#39;s vector representation would be &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;1, 1, 0, -2, 0, 0, 0&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you multiply two quantities, their vectors are added together to make a new quantity. When you divide them, the second one is subtracted from the first. So, returning to the bathtub example, the volume would have a vector representation of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the rate would be &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;0, 3, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;V/r&lt;/code&gt; would be &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;0, 3-3, 0, 0-(-1), 0, 0, 0&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, or just &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (seconds). Units can also come with a multiplier (the foot is a multiple of the metre) or an offset (the degree Celcius is offset from the kelvin). And they can have prefixes that apply a multiple: kilo multiplies by 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, centi multiplies by 10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. That&#39;s about it for units! Though of course, there are some edge cases, such as the kilogram being the only base unit with a prefix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type system is strongly typed, which means it complains when you pass a Fraction to a function that expects an Integer. There are basically two types of types: numeric types, which are arranged in the hierarchy Real &amp;lt; Fraction &amp;lt; Integer, and a Quantity type all on its own. An Integer can pass as a Real, because it&#39;s further down the hierarchy, but not vice versa. I got the type hierarchy idea from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP). Another trick I stole from SICP: if a Fraction can be simplified to an Integer, then this is done automatically, so that &lt;code&gt;6/2&lt;/code&gt; is always simplified to &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;. The implementation language of ka is Python, and the fact that Python has a module for &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html&#34;&gt;fractions&lt;/a&gt; and a module for &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html&#34;&gt;numeric types&lt;/a&gt; made my work on the type system a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there you have it. A calculator language in about 1400 lines of Python code. If anyone happens to read this and happens to try out ka, I&#39;d be curious to hear how you get on with it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
